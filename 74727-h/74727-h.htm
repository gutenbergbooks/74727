<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<span class="smcap">The Struggle for Supremacy on the Sea</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CAPTAIN MAHAN’S thesis that in any
great war the nation possessing the
greater sea power is likely to win, has been
splendidly illustrated during the World War.
The great English fleets have been the insuperable
obstacle to the ambitious German plans
of world dominion. The millions of soldiers
landed in France from Great Britain, and its
provinces, the millions of Americans transported
in safety across the water, and the
enormous quantities of supplies put at the disposal
of the Allies depended, absolutely, upon
the Allied control of the sea routes of the
world. With a superior navy a German
blockade of England would have brought her
to terms in a short period, and France, left to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
fight alone, would have been an easy victim.
The British navy has saved the world.</p>

<p>Germany had for many years well understood
the necessity of power upon the sea.
When the war broke out it was the second
greatest of the sea powers. Its ships were
mostly modern, for its navy was a creation of
the past fifteen years, and its development was
obviously for the purpose of attacking the
British supremacy. The father of this new
navy was a naval officer by the name of von
Tirpitz, who, in 1897, had become the German
Naval Minister. With the aid of the Emperor
he had aroused among the Germans a
great enthusiasm for maritime power, and had
built up a navy in fifteen years, which was
second only to the English navy.</p>

<p>Von Tirpitz was an interesting character.
In appearance he looked like an old sea-wolf
who had passed his life on the wave, but such
a thought would be a mistake. The great admiral
has done his work on land; he is an organizer,
a diplomatist, a politician. He has
created nothing new; in all its details he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
copied the English fleet. He is tall, heavily
built, with a great white beard, forked in the
middle. He is a man of much dignity, with
a smile which has won him renown. He
might have been Chancellor of the Empire, but
he preferred to devote himself to the navy, to
prove that the future of Germany is on the
seas. His glories are the Lusitania, the fleet
safely anchored at Kiel, and the long rows of
innocent victims of the submarine.</p>

<p>He was born in 1850 at Kustrion on the
Ildor, when the German navy was only a little
group of worthless boats. In 1865 he entered
the School of Cadets, in 1869 he was gazetted
lieutenant, in 1875 he was lieutenant-commander
with a reputation as an able organizer.
In 1891 he was appointed Chief of
Staff at Kiel. This was his opportunity, and
he set himself at the task of creating and protecting
the submarine division of the navy.
As time went on he grew in importance. In
1898 he became Assistant Secretary of State at
the Admiralty in Berlin. Two years later he
became vice-admiral. His admirers recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
his powers, and he was called the master.
In 1899 a patent of nobility was conferred
upon him. In 1902 he gained permission to
build 13,000-ton warships, and the following
year he was made admiral. In 1907 enormous
appropriations were made at his desire
for the enlargement of the fleet. In 1908 Emperor
William conferred on him the Order of
the Black Eagle. In 1904 the Kiel Canal was
completed under his direction, and he informed
the Emperor that the fleet was ready. It is
only fair to add that in all his plans he had
the active support of his Imperial Master.
The Kaiser, too, had dreamed a dream. Von
Tirpitz admired the English. His children
had been brought up in England, as was also
his wife. He imitated the English, but on the
day of the declaration of war he absolutely
forbade his family to talk English, and he
made a bonfire of his fine scientific library of
English books. The Kaiser treated Von Tirpitz
as his friend, asked his advice, and followed
his counsel. His son, Sub-Lieutenant
Wolf Von Tirpitz, studied at Oxford, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
on the most friendly terms with many English
gentlemen of importance. He was on board
the Mainz, which was sunk off Helgoland in
August, 1916. In full uniform he swam for
twenty minutes, before being picked up by one
of the boats of the cruiser Liverpool. He was
a lucky prisoner of war. The German battleships
and cruisers which represent the toil of
Von Tirpitz for more than half a century, lay
hidden away in the shelter of the Kiel Canal
during the war to be ingloriously surrendered
at its end. His name will remain linked with
that of the Lusitania.</p>

<p>The German High Sea Fleet, at the beginning
of the war, consisted of forty-one battleships,
seven battle cruisers, nine armored cruisers,
forty-nine light cruisers, one hundred and
forty-five destroyers, eighty torpedo boats, and
thirty-eight submarines. Under the direction
of Von Tirpitz the navy had become democratic
and had drawn to it many able men of
the middle class. Its training was highly specialized
and the officers were enthusiasts in their
profession. The navy of Austria-Hungary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
had also expanded in recent years under the
inspiration of Admiral Montecuculi. At the
outbreak of the war the fleet comprised sixteen
battleships, two armored and twelve light
cruisers, eighteen destroyers, eighty-five torpedo
boats and eleven submarines. The Allies
were much more powerful. The French
navy had in the matter of invention given the
lead to the world, but its size had not kept
pace with its quality. At the beginning of
the war France had thirty-one battleships,
twenty-four armored cruisers, eight light cruisers,
eighty-seven destroyers, one hundred and
fifty-three torpedo boats and seventy-six submarines.
Russia, after the war with Japan,
had begun the creation of a powerful battle
fleet, which had not been completed when war
was declared. At that time she had on the
Baltic four dreadnoughts, ten armored cruisers,
eighty destroyers and twenty-four submarines,
and a fleet of about half the strength
in the Black Sea.</p>

</figure>

<p>The English fleet had reached a point of
efficiency which was unprecedented in its history.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
The progress of the German sea power
had stimulated the spirit of the fleet, and led
to a steady advance in training and equipment.
The development of armament, and of
battleship designing, the improvement in gunnery
practice, the revision of the rate of pay,
the opening up of careers from the lower deck,
and the provision of a naval air service are
landmarks in the advance. In the navy estimates
of March, 1914, Parliament sanctioned
over £51,000,000 for a naval defense, the largest
appropriation for the purpose ever made.
The home fleet was arranged in three units,
the first fleet was divided into four battle
squadrons, together with the flagship of the
commander-in-chief. The first squadron was
made up of eight battleships, the second squadron
contained eight, the third eight and the
fourth four. Attached to each fleet was a battle
cruiser squadron, consisting of four ships
in the first fleet, four in the second, four in the
third and five in the fourth. The fourth also
contained a light cruiser squadron, a squadron
of six gunboats for mine sweeping, and four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
flotillas of destroyers, each with a flotilla
cruiser attached. The second fleet was composed
of two battle squadrons, the first containing
eight pre-dreadnoughts, and the second
six. Attached to this fleet were also two
cruiser squadrons, a mine layer squadron of
seven vessels, four patrol flotillas, consisting
of destroyers and torpedo boats, and seven flotillas
of submarines. A third fleet contained
two battle squadrons, mainly composed of old
ships, with six cruiser squadrons. The English
strength, outside home waters, consisted of
the Mediterranean fleet, containing three battle
cruisers, four armored cruisers, four ordinary
cruisers and a flotilla of seventeen destroyers,
together with submarines and torpedo
boats. In eastern waters there were a battleship,
two cruisers, and four sloops. In the
China squadron there were one battleship, two
armored cruisers, two ordinary cruisers, and
a number of gunboats, destroyers, submarines,
and torpedo boats. In New Zealand there
were four cruisers. The Australian fleet contained
a battle cruiser, three ordinary cruisers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
three destroyers and two submarines. Other
cruisers and gunboats were stationed at the
Cape, the west coast of Africa, and along the
western Atlantic. At the outbreak of the war
two destroyers were purchased from Chile, and
two Turkish battleships, building in England,
were commandeered by the government.</p>

<p>It is evident that the union of France and
Britain made the Allies easily superior in the
Mediterranean Sea, so that France was able to
transport her African troops in safety, and the
British commerce with India and the East
could safely continue. The main field of the
naval war, therefore, was the North Sea and
the Baltic, where Germany had all her fleet,
except a few naval raiders. The entrance to
the Baltic was closed to the enemy by Denmark,
which, as a neutral, was bound to prevent
an enemy fleet from passing. Germany,
however, by means of the Kiel Canal, could
permit the largest battle fleet to pass from the
Baltic to the North Sea. The German High
Sea Fleet was weaker than the British home
fleet by more than forty per cent, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
German policy, therefore, was to avoid a battle,
until, through mine layers and submarines,
the British power should have been sufficiently
weakened. The form of the German coast
made this plan easily possible. The various
bays and river mouths provided safe retreat
for the German ships, and the German fleet
were made secure by the fortifications along
the coast. On July the 29th, 1914, at the
conclusion of the annual maneuvers, instead
of being demobilized as would have been usual,
the Grand Fleet of Great Britain sailed from
Portland along the coast into the mists, and
from that moment dominated the whole course
of the war.</p>

<p>From the 4th of August, the date of the declaration
of war, the oceans of the world were
practically rid of enemy warships, and were
closed to enemy mercantile marine. Although
diplomacy had not yet failed, the masters of
the English navy were not caught napping.
The credit for this readiness has been given to
Mr. Winston Churchill, one of the first Lords
of the Admiralty, who had divined the coming
danger. When the grand fleet sailed it
seemed to disappear from English view. Occasionally
some dweller along the coast might
see an occasional cruiser or destroyer sweeping
by in the distance, but the great battleships had
gone. Somewhere, in some hidden harbor,
lay the vigilant fleets of England.</p>

to a past generation. The guns of a
battleship would have sunk the Spanish Armada
with one broadside. In this modern day
the battleship was protected by aircraft, which
dropped bombs from the clouds. Unseen submarines
circled about her. Beneath her might
be mines, which could destroy her at the slightest
touch. Everything had changed but the
daring of the English sailor.</p>

<p>In command of the Home fleet was Admiral
Sir John Jellicoe. He had had a distinguished
career. Beginning as a lieutenant in the
Egyptian War of 1882, he had become a commander
in 1891. In 1897 he became a captain,
and served in China, commanding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Naval Brigade in the Pekin Expedition of
1900, where he was severely wounded. Later
he became naval assistant to the Controller of
the Navy, Director of Naval Ordnance and
Torpedoes, Rear-Admiral in the United fleet,
Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty and
Controller of the Navy, Vice-Admiral commanding
the Atlantic fleet, Vice-Admiral commanding
the second division of the Home fleet,
and second Sea Lord of the Admiralty. He
had distinguished himself in the naval maneuvers
of 1913, and was one of the officers mainly
responsible for the development of the modern
English navy. He had the confidence of
his colleagues, and a peculiar popularity among
the British seamen.</p>

<p>On the day after the declaration of war, the
first shots were fired. German mine layers, it
is now believed, in disguise, had been dropping
mines during the preceding week over a
wide area of the North Sea. On the 5th of
August the mine layer, Koenigen Luise, was
sunk by the destroyer Lance, and on August
6th the British light cruiser Amphion struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
one of the mines laid by the Koenigen Luise
and was sunk with great loss of life. On August
9th, German submarines attacked a cruiser
squadron without causing any damage, and one
submarine was sunk.</p>

<p>It was in the Mediterranean, however, that
the greatest interest was felt during the first
week of the war. Two German warships, the
Goeben and the Breslau, were off the Algerian
coast when war broke out. It is probable that
when these ships received their sailing orders,
Germany depended on the assistance of Italy,
and had sent these ships to its assistance.
They were admirably suited for commerce destroyers.
They began by bombarding the Algerian
coast towns of Bona and Phillipe, doing
little damage. They then turned toward
the coast of Gibraltar, but found before them
the British fleet. Eluding the British they
next appeared at Messina. There the captains
and officers made their wills and deposited
their valuables, including signed portraits
of the Kaiser, with the German consul.
The decks were cleared for action, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the bands playing they sailed out under a
blood-red sunset.</p>

<p>However, they seem to have been intent
only on escape, and they went at full speed
eastward toward the Dardanelles, meeting in
their way only with the British cruiser Gloucester,
which, though much inferior in size, attacked
them boldly but was unable to prevent
their escape. On entering Constantinople
they were reported as being sold to the Turkish
Government, the Turks thus beginning the
line of conduct which was ultimately to bring
them into the war.</p>

<p>Picturesque as this incident was it was of no
importance as compared with the great British
blockade of Germany which began on the 4th
of August. German merchantmen in every
country of the empire were seized, and hundreds
of ships were captured on the high seas.
Those who escaped to neutral ports were at
once interned. In a week German commerce
had ceased to exist. A few German cruisers
were still at large but it was not long before
they had been captured, or driven into neutral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
ports. Among the most picturesque of these
raiders were the Emden and the Koenigsburg.
The Emden, in particular, interested the world
with her romantic adventures. Her story is
best told in the words of Lieutenant-Captain
von Mücke, and Lieutenant Gyssing, whose
return to Germany with forty-four men, four
officers and one surgeon, after the destruction
of the ship, was a veritable Odyssey.</p>

<p>“We on the Emden had no idea where we
were going, as, on August 11, 1914, we separated
from the cruiser squadron, escorted only
by the coaler Markomannia. Under way the
Emden picked up three officers from German
steamers. That was a piece of luck, for afterward
we needed many officers for the capturing
and sinking of steamers, or manning them
when we took them with us. On September
10th, the first boat came in sight. We stopped
her; she proved to be a Greek tramp returning
from England. On the next day we met
the Indus, bound for Bombay, all fitted up as
a troop transport, but still without troops.
That was the first one we sunk. The crew we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
took aboard the Markomannia. Then we sank
the Lovat, a troop transport ship, and took
the Kambinga along with us. One gets used
quickly to new forms of activity. After a
few days, capturing ships became a habit. Of
the twenty-three which we captured most of
them stopped after our first signal; when they
didn’t we fired a blank shot. Then they all
stopped. Only one, the Clan Matteson,
waited for a real shot across the bow before
giving up its many automobiles and locomotives
to the seas.</p>

<p>“The officers were mostly very polite, and
let down rope ladders for us. After a few
hours they would be on board with us. We
ourselves never set foot in their cabins, nor took
charge of them. The officers often acted on
their own initiative, and signaled to us the nature
of their cargo. Then the commandant
decided as to whether to sink the ship or take
it with us. Of the cargo we always took everything
we could use, particularly provisions.
Many of the English officers and sailors made
good use of the hours of transfer to drink up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the supply of whisky instead of sacrificing it to
the waves. I heard that one captain was lying
in tears at the enforced separation from his
beloved ship, but on investigation found that
he was merely dead drunk. The captain on
one ship once called out cheerily ‘Thank God,
I’ve been captured.’ He had received expense
money for the trip to Australia, and was now
saved half the journey.”</p>

<p>Parenthetically it may be remarked, that the
Emden’s captain, Karl von Mueller, conducted
himself at all times with chivalrous bravery,
according to the accounts of the English themselves,
who in their reports say of him, admiringly,
“He played the game.” Captain von
Mücke’s account continues:</p>

<p>“We had mostly quiet weather, so that communication
with captured ships was easy.
They were mostly dynamited, or else shot close
to the water line. At Calcutta we made one
of our richest hauls, the Diplomat, chock full of
tea, we sunk $2,500,000 worth. On the same
day the Trabbotch, too, which steered right
straight towards us, was captured. By now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
we wanted to beat it out of the Bay of Bengal,
because we had learned from the papers that
the Emden was being keenly searched for. By
Rangoon we encountered a Norwegian tramp,
which, for a cash consideration, took over all
the rest of our prisoners of war.</p>

<p>“On September 23d we reached Madras, and
steered straight for the harbor. We stopped
still 3,000 yards before the city. Then we shot
up the oil tanks; three or four of them burned
up and illuminated the city. Two days later
we navigated around Ceylon, and could see the
lights of Colombo. On the same evening we
gathered in two more steamers, the King
Lund, and Tywerse. The next evening we
got the Burresk, a nice steamer with 500 tons
of nice Cardiff coal. Then followed in order,
the Ryberia, Foyle, Grand Ponrabbel, Benmore,
Troiens, Exfort, Graycefale, Sankt
Eckbert, Chilkana. Most of them were sunk.
The coal ships were kept. All this happened
before October 20th. Then we sailed southward
to Deogazia, southwest of Colombo.”</p>

<p>The captain then tells with much gusto a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
story of a visit paid to the Emden by some
English farmers, at Deogazia, who were entertained
royally by the Emden officers. They
knew nothing about the war, and the Emden
officers told them nothing. His narrative continues:</p>

<p>“Now we went toward Miniko, where we
sank two ships more. On the next day we
found three steamers to the north, one of them
with much desired Cardiff coal. From English
papers on the captured ships we learned
that we were being hotly pursued. One night
we started for Penang. On October 28th we
raised a very practical fourth smokestack (for
disguise). The harbor of Penang lies in a
channel difficult of access. There was nothing
doing by night. We had to do it at daybreak.
At high speed, without smoke, with lights out,
we steered into the mouth of the channel. A
torpedo boat on guard slept well. We
steamed past its small light. Inside lay a dark
silhouette. That must be a warship. We
recognized the silhouette dead sure. That
was the Russian cruiser Jemtchud. There it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
lay, there it slept like a rat, no watch to be seen.
They made it easy for us. Because of the narrowness
of the harbor we had to keep close;
we fired the first torpedo at four hundred
yards.</p>

<p>“Then, to be sure, things livened up a bit on
the sleeping warship. At the same time we
took the crew quarters under fire five shells at
a time. There was a flash of flame on board,
then a kind of burning aureole. After the
fourth shell the flame burned high. The first
torpedo had struck the ship too deep, because
we were too close to it. A second torpedo
which we fired off from the other side didn’t
make the same mistake. After twenty seconds
there was absolutely not a trace of the ship to
be seen.</p>

<p>“But now another ship which we couldn’t
see was firing. That was the French D’Ivrebreville,
toward which we now turned at once.
A few minutes later an incoming torpedo destroyer
was reported. It proved to be the
French torpedo boat Mousquet. It came
straight toward us. That’s always remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
a mystery to me, for it must have heard the
shooting. An officer whom we fished up afterward
explained to me that they had only
recognized we were a German warship when
they were quite close to us. The Frenchman
behaved well, accepted battle and fought on,
but was polished off by us with three broadsides.
The whole fight with those ships lasted
half an hour. The commander of the torpedo
boat lost both legs by the first broadside.
When he saw that part of his crew were leaping
overboard he cried out ‘Tie me fast. I
will not survive after seeing Frenchmen desert
their ship.’ As a matter of fact he went down
with his ship, as a brave captain, lashed fast to
the mast. That was my only sea-fight.</p>

<p>“On November 9th I left the Emden in order
to destroy the wireless plant on the Cocos
Island. I had fifty men, four machine guns
and about thirty rifles. Just as we were about
to destroy the apparatus it reported ‘Careful.
Emden near.’ The work of destruction went
smoothly. Presently the Emden signaled to
us ‘Hurry up.’ I pack up, but simultaneously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
wails the Emden’s siren. I hurry up to the
bridge, see the flag ‘Anna’ go up. That means
weigh anchor. We ran like mad into our boat,
but already the Emden’s pennant goes up, the
battle flag is raised, they fire from starboard.
The enemy is concealed by the island, and
therefore not to be seen, but I see the shell
strike the water. To follow and catch the
Emden is out of question. She is going
twenty knots, I only four with my steam pinnace.
Therefore I turn back to land, raise the
flag, declare German laws of war in force,
seize all arms, set out my machine guns on
shore in order to guard against a hostile landing.
Then I run again in order to observe the
fight.”</p>

<p>The cable operator at Cocos Island gives the
following account of what happened from this
point. After describing the sudden flight of
the Emden, he goes on:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe45" id="i_022">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="HIDE AND SEEK IN THE BALTIC">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE BALTIC</p>

<p>A Zeppelin flying over a British submarine in the stormy sea.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Looking to the eastward we could see the
reason for this sudden departure, for a warship,
which we afterwards learned was the Australian
cruiser Sydney, was coming up at full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
speed in pursuit. The Emden did not wait
to discuss matters, but, firing her first shot at
a range of about 3,700 yards, steamed north as
hard as she could go. At first the firing of the
Emden seemed excellent, while that of the Sydney
was somewhat erratic. This, as I afterward
learned, was due to the fact that the Australian
cruiser’s range finder was put out of
action by one of the only two shots the Germans
got home. However, the British gunners
soon overcame any difficulties that this
may have caused, and settled down to their
work, so that before long two of the Emden’s
funnels had been shot away. She also lost one
of her masts quite early in the fight. Both
blazing away with their big guns the two
cruisers disappeared below the horizon, the
Emden being on fire.</p>

<p>“Early the next morning, Tuesday, November
10th, we saw the Sydney returning, and at
8.45 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> she anchored off the island. From
various members of the crew I gathered some
details of the running fight with the Emden.
The Sydney, having an advantage in speed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
was able to keep out of range of the Emden’s
guns, and to bombard with her own heavier
metal. The engagement lasted eighty minutes,
the Emden finally running ashore on
North Keeling Island, and becoming an utter
wreck. Only two German shots proved
effective, one of these failed to explode, but
smashed the main range finder and killed one
man, the other killed three men and wounded
fourteen.</p>

<p>“Each of the cruisers attempted to torpedo
the other, but both were unsuccessful, and the
duel proved a contest in hard pounding at long
range. The Sydney’s speed during the fighting
was twenty-six knots, and the Emden’s
twenty-four knots. The British ship’s superiority
of two knots enabled her to choose
the range at which the battle should be fought
and to make the most of her superior guns.
Finally, with a number of wounded prisoners
on board, the Sydney left here yesterday, and
our few hours of war excitement were over.”</p>

<p>Captain Mücke’s return home from the
Cocos Island was filled with the most extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
adventures, and when he finally arrived
in country controlled by his Allies he was
greeted as a hero.</p>

<p>While the story of the Emden especially interested
the world, the Koenigsburg also
caused much trouble to English commerce.
Her chief exploit occurred on the 20th of September,
when she caught the British cruiser
Pegasus in Zanzibar harbor undergoing repairs.
The Pegasus had no chance, and was
destroyed by the Koenigsburg’s long-range
fire. Nothing much was heard later of the
Koenigsburg, which was finally destroyed by
an English cruiser, July 11, 1915.</p>

<p>The exploits of these two German commerce
raiders attracted general attention, because
they were the exceptions to the rule. The
British, on the other hand, were able to capture
such German merchantmen as ventured on
the sea without great difficulty, and as they
did not destroy their capture, but brought
them before prize courts, the incidents attracted
no great attention. The Kaiser Wilhelm
der Grosse, which had been fitted up as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
commerce-destroyer by the Germans at the beginning
of the war, as was the Spreewald of
the Hamburg-American Line, and the Cap
Trafalgar, were caught and sunk during the
month of September. On the whole, English
foreign trade was unimpaired.</p>

<p>But though the German fleet had been bottled
up in her harbors, Germany was not yet
impotent. There remained the submarine.</p>

<p>Up to 1905 Germany had not a single submarine.
The first German submarine was
launched on August 30, 1905. Even then it
was considered merely an experiment. In
February, 1907, it was added to the register
of the fleet. On January 1, 1901, there were
only four nations that possessed submarines,
France, with fourteen; the United States, with
eight; England, with six, of which not one was
completed, and finally Italy, with two. In
1910, Germany appropriated 18,750,000 marks
for submarines, and in 1913, 25,000,000 marks.
On January 1, 1914, the total number of submarines
of all nations was approximately four
hundred.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Early in the war the submarine became a
grave menace to the English navy and to English
commerce. On the 5th of September the
Pathfinder, a light cruiser, was torpedoed and
sunk with great loss of life. On September
22d, three cruisers, the Cressy, Hogue, and
Aboukir were engaged in patrolling the coast
of Holland. A great storm had been raging
and the cruisers were not protected by the
usual screen of destroyers. At half-past six
in the morning the seas had fallen and the
cruisers proceeded to their posts. The report
of Commander Nicholson, of the Cressy, of
what followed gives a good idea of the effectiveness
of the submarine.</p>

<p>“The Aboukir,” says the report, “was struck
at about 6.25 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> on the starboard beam.
The Hogue and Cressy closed, and took up a
position, the Hogue ahead of the Aboukir, and
the Cressy about four hundred yards on her
port beam. As soon as it was seen that Aboukir
was in danger of sinking, all the boats were
sent away from the Cressy, and a picket boat
was hoisted out without steam up. When cutters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
full of the Aboukir’s men were returning
to the Cressy, the Hogue was struck, apparently
under the aft 9.2 magazine, as a very
heavy explosion took place immediately. Almost
directly after the Hogue was hit we observed
a periscope on our port bow about three
hundred yards off. Fire was immediately
opened, and the engines were put full speed
ahead with the intention of running her down.</p>

<p>“Captain Johnson then maneuvered the ship
so as to render assistance to the crews of the
Hogue and Aboukir. About five minutes
later another periscope was seen on our starboard
quarter, and fire was opened. The
track of the torpedo she fired at a range of
from 500 to 600 yards was plainly visible, and
it struck us on the starboard side just before
the after bridge. The ship listed about ten degrees
to the starboard and remained steady.
The time was 7.15 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> All the watertight
doors, dead lights and scuttles had been securely
closed before the torpedoes left the ship.
All mess stools and table shores and all available
timber below and on deck had been previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
got up and thrown overside for the saving
of life. A second torpedo fired by the
same submarine missed and passed about ten
feet astern.</p>

<p>“About a quarter of an hour after the first
torpedo had hit, a third torpedo fired from the
submarine just before the starboard beam, hit
us under the No. 5 boiler room. The time was
7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> The ship then began to heel rapidly,
and finally turned keel up remaining so
for about twenty minutes before she finally
sank. It is possible that the same submarine
fired all three torpedoes at the Cressy.”</p>

<p>Of the total crews of 1,459 officers and men
only 779 were saved. The survivors believed
that they had seen at least three submarines,
but the German official account mentions only
one, the U-9, under Captain-Lieutenant Otto
Weddigen whose account of this battle confirms
the report of Commander Nicholson.
Referring to the reports that a flotilla of German
submarines had attacked the cruisers, he
says:</p>

<p>“These reports were absolutely untrue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
U-9 was the only submarine on deck.” He
adds: “I reached the home port on the afternoon
of the 23d and on the 24th went to Wilhelmshaven
to find that news of my effort had
become public. My wife, dry-eyed when I
went away, met me with tears. Then I
learned that my little vessel and her brave crew
had won the plaudit of the Kaiser, who conferred
upon each of my co-workers the Iron
Cross of the second class and upon me the Iron
Crosses of the first and second classes.”</p>

<p>Weddigen was the hero of the hour in Germany.
He had with him twenty-five men.
He seems to have acted with courage and skill,
but it is also evident that the English staff
work was to blame. Three such vessels should
never have been sent out without a screen of
destroyers, nor should the Hogue and the
Cressy have gone to the rescue of the Aboukir.
A few days after the disaster the English admiralty
issued the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sinking of the Aboukir was of course an ordinary
hazard of patrolling duty. The Hogue and Cressy,
however, were sunk because they proceeded to the assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of their consort, and remained with engines
stopped, endeavoring to save life, thus presenting an
easy target to further submarine attacks. The natural
promptings of humanity have in this case led to heavy
losses, which would have been avoided by a strict adhesion
to military consideration. Modern naval war is
presenting us with so many new and strange situations
that an error of judgment of this character is pardonable.
But it has become necessary to point out for the
future guidance of His Majesty’s ships that the conditions
which prevail when one vessel of a squadron is
injured in the mine field, or is exposed to submarine attack,
are analogous to those which occur in action, and
that the rule of leaving ships to their own resources is
applicable, so far, at any rate, as large vessels are concerned.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 28th of August occurred the first important
naval action of the war, the battle of
Helgoland. From the 9th of August German
cruisers had shown activity in the seas around
Helgoland and had sunk a number of British
trawlers. The English submarines, E-6 and
E-8, and the light cruiser Fearless, had patrolled
the seas, and on the 21st of August the
Fearless had come under the enemy’s shell fire.
On August 26th the submarine flotilla, under
Commodore Keyes, sailed from Harwich for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the Bight of Helgoland, and all the next day
the Lurcher and the Firedrake, destroyers,
scouted for submarines. On that same day
sailed the first and third destroyer flotillas, the
battle cruiser squadron, first light cruiser
squadron, and the seventh cruiser squadron,
having a rendezvous at this point on the morning
of the 28th.</p>

<p>The morning was beautiful and clear, so that
the submarines could be easily seen. Close to
Helgoland were Commodore Keyes’ eight submarines,
and his two small destroyers. Approaching
rapidly from the northwest were
Commodore Tyrwhitt’s two destroyer flotillas,
a little to the east was Commodore Goodenough’s
first light cruiser squadron. Behind
this squadron were Sir David Beatty’s battle
cruisers with four destroyers. To the south
and west of Helgoland lay Admiral Christian’s
seventh cruiser squadron.</p>

<p>Presently from behind Helgoland came a
number of German destroyers, followed by two
cruisers; and the English submarines, with the
two small destroyers, fled westwards, acting as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
a decoy. As the Germans followed, the British
destroyer flotillas on the northwest came
rapidly down. At the sight of these destroyers
the German destroyers fled, and the British attempted
to head them off.</p>

<p>According to the official report the principle
of the movement was to cut the German light
craft from home, and engage it at leisure on the
open sea.</p>

<p>But between the two German cruisers and
English cruisers a fierce battle took place. The
Arethusa was engaged with the German
Ariadne, and the Fearless with the Strasburg.
A shot from the Arethusa shattered the fore
bridge of the Ariadne and killed the captain,
and both German cruisers drew off to Helgoland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the destroyers were engaged in
a hot fight. They sunk the leading boat of the
German flotilla and damaged a dozen more.
Between nine and ten o’clock there was a lull
in the fight; the submarines, with some of the
destroyers, remained in the neighborhood of
Helgoland, and the Germans, believing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
these boats were the only hostile vessels in the
neighborhood, determined to attack them.</p>

<p>The Mainz, the Koln, and the Strasburg
came again on the scene, and opened a heavy
fire on some of the boats of the first flotilla
which were busy saving life. The small destroyers
were driven away, but the seamen in
the boats were rescued by an English submarine.
The Arethusa and the Fearless, with
the destroyers in their company, engaged with
three enemy cruisers. The Strasburg, seriously injured,
was compelled to flee. The
boilers of the Mainz blew up, and she became
a wreck. The Koln only remaining and carrying
on the fight.</p>

<p>The English destroyers were much crippled,
and as the battle had now lasted for five hours
any moment the German great battleships
might come on the scene. A wireless signal
had been sent to Sir David Beatty, asking for
help, and about twelve o’clock the Falmouth
and the Nottingham arrived on the scene of
action. By this time the first destroyer flotilla
was out of action and the third flotilla and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Arethusa had their hands full with the Koln.
The light cruisers were followed at 12.15 by the
English battle cruisers, the Lion came first, and
she alone among the battle cruisers seems to
have used her guns. Her gun power beat
down all opposition. The Koln made for
home, but the Lion’s guns set her on fire. The
luckless Ariadne hove in sight, but the terrible
13.5-inch guns sufficed for her. The battle
Cruisers circled around, and in ten minutes the
Koln went to the bottom.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes to two, Admiral Beatty
turned homeward. The German cruisers
Mainz, Koln, and the Ariadne had been sunk;
the Strasburg was seriously damaged. One
destroyer was sunk, and at least seven seriously
injured. About seven hundred of the German
crew perished and there were three hundred
prisoners. The British force returned without
the loss of a single ship. The Arethusa had
been badly damaged, but was easily repaired.
The casualty list was thirty-two killed and
fifty-two wounded. The battle was fought on
both sides with great gallantry, the chief glory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
belonging to the Arethusa and the Fearless
who bore the brunt of the battle. The strategy
and tactical skill employed were admirable, and
the German admiral, Von Ingenohl, from that
time on, with one exception, kept his battleships
in harbor, and confined his activities to
mine laying and the use of submarines.</p>

<p>In the first days of the war the German mine
layers had been busy. By means of trawlers
disguised as neutrals, mines were dropped off
the north coast of Ireland, and a large mine
field was laid off the eastern coast of England.
One of the most important duties of the Royal
Naval Reserve was the task of mine sweeping.
Over seven hundred mine-sweeping vessels
were constantly employed in keeping an area
of 7,200 square miles clear for shipping.
These ships swept 15,000 square miles
monthly, and steamed over 1,100,000 miles in
carrying out their duties. In spite of all these
precautions many English ships were destroyed
by the mines.</p>

<p>It would be hard to overestimate the effect
of the British blockade of the German ports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
upon the fortunes of the war. The Germans
for a long time attempted, by the use of neutral
ships, to obtain the necessary supplies through
Holland, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland.
Millions of dollars’ worth of food and munitions
ultimately reached German hands. The
imports of all these nations were multiplied
many times, but as the time went on the blockade
grew stricter and stricter until the Germans
felt the pinch. To conduct efficiently
this blockade meant the use of over 3,600 vessels
which were added to the auxiliary patrol
service. Over 13,000 vessels were intercepted
and examined by units of the British navy employed
on blockade channels.</p>

<p>The Germans protested with great vigor
against this blockade, and ultimately endeavored
to counteract it by declaring unrestricted
submarine warfare. In fact, Great Britain had
gone too far, and vigorous protests from
America followed her attempt to seize contraband
goods in American vessels.</p>

<p>The code of maritime law, adopted in the
Declaration at Paris of 1856, as well as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Declaration in London of 1909, had been
framed in the interests of unmaritime nations.
The British plenipotentiaries had agreed to
these laws on the theory that in any war of the
future Britain would be neutral. The rights
of neutrals had been greatly increased. A
blockade was difficult to enforce, for the right
of a blockading power to capture a blockade
runner did not cover the whole period of her
voyage, and was confined to ships of the blockading
force. A ship carrying contraband
could only be condemned if the contraband
formed more than half its cargo. A belligerent
warship could destroy a neutral vessel without
taking it into a port for a judgment. The
transfer of an enemy vessel to a neutral flag
was presumed to be valid, if effected more than
thirty days before the outbreak of war. Belligerents
in neutral vessels on the high seas
were exempt from capture. The Emden
could justify its sinking of British ships, but
the English were handicapped in their endeavor
to prevent neutral ships from carrying
supplies to Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>But Germany had become a law unto itself.
And England found it necessary in retaliation
to issue orders in council which made
nugatory many of the provisions of the maritime
code. The protests of the American
Government and those of other neutrals were
treated with the greatest consideration, and
every endeavor was made that no real injustice
should be done. When America itself later
entered the war these differences of opinion disappeared
from public view.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<span class="smcap">The Sublime Porte</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS soon as the diplomatic relations between
Austria and Serbia had been broken, the
Turkish Grand Vizier informed the diplomatic
corps in Constantinople that Turkey would
remain neutral in the conflict. The declaration
was not formal, for war had not yet been
declared. The policy of Turkey, as represented
in the ministerial paper, <i>Tasfiri-Efkiar</i>,
was as follows:</p>

<p>“Turkey has never asked for war, as she always
has worked toward avoiding it, but neutrality
does not mean indifference. The present
Austro-Serbian conflict is to a supreme degree
interesting to us. In the first place, one
of our erstwhile opponents is fighting against
a much stronger enemy. In the natural course
of things Serbia, which till lately was expressing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
in a rather open way, her solidarity as a
nation, still provoking us, and Greece, will be
materially weakened. In the second place,
the results of this war may surpass the limits
of the conflict between two countries, and in
that case our interests will be just as materially
affected. We must, therefore, keep our eyes
open, as the circumstances are momentarily
changing, and do not permit us to let escape
certain advantages which we can secure by active,
and rightly acting, diplomacy. The policy
of neutrality will impose on us the obligation
of avoiding to side with either of the belligerents.
But the same policy will force us to
take all the necessary measures for safeguarding
our interests and our frontiers.”</p>

<p>Whereupon a Turkish mobilization was at
once ordered. The war had hardly begun
when Turkey received the news that her two
battleships, building in British yards, had been
taken over by England. A bitter feeling
against England was at once aroused, Turkish
mobs proceeded to attack the British stores
and British subjects, and attempts were even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
made against the British embassy in Constantinople,
and the British consulate at Smyrna.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Stretch or Territory Controlled by Turkey in 1914</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At this time Turkey was in a peculiar position.
For a century she had been on the best
of terms with France and Great Britain. On
the other hand Russia had been her hereditary
enemy. She was still suffering from her defeat
by the Balkan powers, and her statesmen
saw in this war great possibilities. She desired
to recover her lost provinces in Europe,
and saw at once that she could hope for little
from the Allies in this direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>For some years, too, German intrigues, and,
according to report, German money had enabled
the German Government to control the
leading Turkish statesmen. German generals,
under General Liman von Sanders, were practically
in control of the Turkish army. The
commander-in-chief was Enver Bey, who had
been educated in Germany and was more German
than the Germans. A new system of
organization for the Turkish army had been
established by the Germans, which had substituted
the mechanical German system for the
rough and inefficient Turkish methods. Universal
conscription provided men, and the
Turkish soldier has always been known as a
good soldier. Yet as it turned out the German
training did little for him. Under his
own officers he could fight well, but under
German officers, fighting for a cause which he
neither liked nor understood, he was bound to
fail.</p>

<p>At first the Turkish mobilization was conducted
in such a way as to be ready to act in
common with Bulgaria in an attack against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Greek and Serbian Macedonia, as soon as the
Austrians had obtained a decisive victory over
the Serbians. The entry of Great Britain
into the war interfered with this scheme.
Meantime, though not at war, the Turks were
suffering almost as much as if war had been
declared. Greedy speculators took advantage
of the situation, and the government itself requisitioned
everything it could lay its hands
on.</p>

<p>A Constantinople correspondent, writing on
the 6th of August, says as follows:</p>

<p>“Policemen and sheriffs followed by military
officers are taking by force everything in the
way of foodstuffs, entering the bakeries and
other shops selling victuals, boarding ships
with cargoes of flour, potatoes, wheat and rice,
and taking over virtually everything, giving in
lieu of payment a receipt which is not worth
even the paper on which it is written. In this
way many shops are forced to close, bread has
entirely disappeared from the bakeries, and
Constantinople, the capital of a neutral country,
is already feeling all the troubles and privations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
of a besieged city. Prices for foodstuffs
have soared to inaccessible heights, as
provisions are becoming scarce. Actual hand-to-hand
combats are taking place in the streets
outside the bakeries for the possession of a
loaf of bread, and hungry women with children
in their arms are seen crying and weeping
with despair. Many merchants, afraid
lest the government requisition their goods,
hasten to have their orders canceled, the result
being that no merchandise of any kind is coming
to Constantinople either from Europe or
from Anatolia. Both on account of the recruiting
of their employees, and of shortage of
coal, the companies operating electric tramways
of the city have reduced their service to
the minimum, as no power is available for the
running of the cars. Heartrending scenes are
witnessed in front of the closed doors of the
various banking establishments, where large
posters are to be seen bearing the inscription
‘Closed temporarily by order of the government.’”</p>

<p>Immediately after war was declared between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Germany and Russia the Porte ordered
the Bosporus and Dardanelles closed to every
kind of shipping, at the same time barring the
entrances of these channels with rows of mines.
The first boat to suffer from this measure was
a British merchantman which was sunk outside
the Bosporus, while another had a narrow escape
in the Dardanelles. A large number of
steamers of every nationality waited outside
the straits for the special pilot boats of the
Turkish Government, in order to pass in safety
through the dangerous mine field. This measure
of closing the straits was suggested to
Turkey by Austria and Germany, and was primarily
intended against Russia, as it was
feared that her Black Sea fleet might force its
way into the sea of Marmora and the Ægean.</p>

<p>On August 2d the Turkish Parliament was
prorogued, so that all political power might
center around the Imperial throne. A vigorous
endeavor was made to strengthen the Turkish
navy. Djemal Pasha was placed at its
head with Arif Bey as chief of the naval staff.
Talaat Bey and Halil Bey were sent to Bucharest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to exchange views with Roumanian
statesmen, and representatives of the Greek
Government, in regard to the outstanding
Greco-Turkish difficulties.</p>

<p>On September 10th an official announcement
from the Sublime Porte was issued defining
in the first place many constitutional reforms,
and in particular abolishing the capitulation,
that is, the concessions made by law to
foreigners, allowing them participation in the
administration of justice, exemption from taxation,
and special protection in their business
transactions. In abolishing these capitulations
the Ottoman Government declared that
it would treat foreign countries in accordance
with the rules of international law, and that it
was acting without any hostile feeling against
any of the foreign states.</p>

<p>The Allied governments formally protested
against this action of the Turkish Government.
Meantime Constantinople was the center of
most elaborate intrigues. The Turkish Government
grew more and more warlike, and
began to threaten, not only Greece, but Russia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and the Triple Entente as well. During this
period the Turkish press maintained an active
campaign against England and the Allies.
Every endeavor was made by the Sublime
Porte to secure Roumanian or Bulgarian co-operation
in a militant policy. The Allies,
seeing the situation, made many promises to
Bulgaria, Greece and Roumania. Bulgaria
was offered Adrianople and Thrace; Greece
was to have Smyrna, and Roumania the Roumanian
provinces in Austria. The jealousy
of these powers of each other prevented an
agreement. The influence of Germany became
more and more preponderant with the
Ottoman Empire; indeed, it is probable that
an understanding had existed between the two
powers from the beginning. The action of
the Turkish Government in regard to the
Goeben and Breslau could hardly have been
possible unless with a previous understanding.
At last the rupture came. The following was
the official Turkish version of the events which
led to the Turkish declaration of war:</p>

<p>“While on the 27th of October a small part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
of the Turkish fleet was maneuvering on the
Black Sea, the Russian fleet, which at first
confined its activities to following and hindering
every one of our movements, finally, on
the 29th, unexpectedly began hostilities by attacking
the Ottoman fleet. During the naval
battle which ensued the Turkish fleet, with the
help of the Almighty, sank the mine layer
Pruth, inflicted severe damage on one of the
Russian torpedo boats, and captured a collier.
A torpedo from the Turkish torpedo boat
Gairet-i-Millet sank the Russian destroyer
Koubanietz, and another from the Turkish torpedo
boat Mouavenet-i-Millet inflicted serious
damage on a Russian coast guard ship. Three
officers and seventy-two sailors rescued by our
men and belonging to the crews of the damaged
and sunken vessels of the Russian fleet
have been made prisoners. The Ottoman Imperial
Fleet, glory be given to the Almighty,
escaped injury, and the battle is progressing
favorably for us. Information received from
our fleet, now in the Black Sea, is as follows:</p>

<p>“From accounts of Russian sailors taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
prisoners, and from the presence of a mine
layer among the Russian fleet, evidence is
gathered that the Russian fleet intended closing
the entrance to the Bosporus with mines,
and destroying entirely the Imperial Ottoman
fleet, after having split it in two. Our fleet,
believing that it had to face an unexpected attack,
and supposing that the Russians had begun
hostilities without a formal declaration of
war, pursued the scattered Russian fleet, bombarded
the port of Sebastopol, destroyed in the
city of Novorossisk fifty petroleum depots,
fourteen military transports, some granaries,
and the wireless telegraph station. In addition
to the above our fleet has sunk in Odessa
a Russian cruiser, and damaged severely another.
It is believed that this second boat was
likewise sunk. Five other steamers full of
cargoes lying in the same port were seriously
damaged. A steamship belonging to the Russian
volunteer fleet was also sunk, and five petroleum
depots were destroyed. In Odessa
and Sebastopol the Russians from the shore
opened fire against our fleet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>The Sultan at once declared war against
Russia, England and France, and issued a
proclamation to his troops, declaring that he
had called them to arms to resist aggression
and that “the very existence of our Empire
and of three hundred million Moslems whom I
have summoned by sacred Fetwa to a supreme
struggle, depend on your victory. Do not forget
that you are brothers in arms of the strongest
and bravest armies of the world, with whom
we are now fighting shoulder to shoulder.”</p>

<p>The Fetwa, or proclamation announcing a
holy war, called upon all Mussulmans capable
of carrying arms, and even upon Mussulman
women to fight against the powers with whom
the Sultan was at war. In this manner the
holy war became a duty, not only for all Ottoman
subjects, but for the three hundred million
Moslems of the earth. On November 5th
Great Britain declared war against Turkey,
ordered the seizure in British ports of Turkish
vessels, and, by an order in Council, annexed
the Island of Cyprus. On the 17th of December,
the Khedive Abbas II, having thrown in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
his lot with Turkey and fled to Constantinople,
Egypt was formally proclaimed a British Protectorate.
The title of Khedive was abolished,
and the throne of Egypt, with the title of Sultan,
was offered to Prince Hussein Kamel
Pasha, the eldest living prince of the house of
Mahomet Ali, an able and enlightened man.
This meant that Britain was now wholly responsible
for the defense of Egypt. The new
Sultan of Egypt made his state entry on December
20th into the Abdin Palace in Cairo.
The progress of the new ruler was received
with great enthusiasm by thousands of spectators.</p>

<p>The King of England sent a telegram of
congratulation with his promise of support:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the occasion when your Highness enters upon
your high office I desire to convey to your Highness the
expression of my most sincere friendship, and the assurance
of my unfailing support in safeguarding the
integrity of Egypt, and in securing her future well being
and prosperity. Your Highness has been called
upon to undertake the responsibilities of your high office
at a grave crisis in the national life of Egypt, and I
feel convinced that you will be able, with the co-operation
of your Ministers, and the Protectorate of Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Britain, successfully to overcome all the influences which
are seeking to destroy the independence of Egypt and
the wealth, liberty and happiness of its people.</p>
</div>

<p>This was Britain’s answer to the Turkish
proclamation of war. The Turks had not
taken this warlike course with entire unanimity.
The Sultan, the Grand Vizier, and
Djavid Bey were in favor of peace, but Enver
Pasha and his colleagues overruled them.
The Odessa incident was unjustified aggression,
deliberately planned to provoke hostilities.
The tricky and corrupt German diplomacy
had won its point.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that the proclamation
of the holy war, a favorite German
scheme, fell flat. The Kaiser, and his advisers,
had counted much upon this raising of the
sacred flag. The Kaiser had visited Constantinople
and permitted himself to be exploited
as a sympathizer with Mohammedanism.
Photographs of him had been taken representing
him in Mohammedan garb, accompanied
by Moslem priests, and a report had been deliberately
circulated throughout Turkey that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
he had become a Moslem. The object of this
camouflage was to stir up the Mohammedans
in the countries controlled by England, risings
were hoped for in Egypt and India, and German
spies had been distributed through those
countries to encourage religious revolts. But
there was almost no response. The Sultan,
it is true, was the head of the Church, but who
was the Sultan? The old Sultan, now dethroned,
and imprisoned, or this new and insignificant
creature placed on the throne by the
young Turk party? The Mohammedan did
not feel himself greatly moved.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war Turkey found
herself unable to make any move to recover
her provinces in Thrace. Greece and Bulgaria
were neutral, and could not be attacked.
Placing herself, therefore, in the hands of her
German advisers, she moved her new army to
those frontiers where it could meet the powers
with whom she was at war. In particular
Germany and Austria desired her aid in Transcaucasia
against the Russian armies. An attack
upon Russia from that quarter would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
mean that many troops which otherwise would
have been used against the Central Powers
must be sent to the Caucasus. The Suez
Canal, too, must be attacked. An expedition
there would compel Great Britain to send out
troops, and perhaps would encourage the
hoped-for rebellion in Egypt and give an opportunity
for religious insurrection in India,
where the Djehad was being preached among
the Mohammedan tribes in the northwest.
The Dardanelles, to be sure, might be threatened,
but the Germans had sent there many
heavy guns and fortifications had been built
which, in expert opinion, made Constantinople
safe.</p>

<p>The Turkish offensive along her eastern
frontier in Transcaucasia and in Persia was
first undertaken. The Persian Gulf had long
been controlled by Great Britain; even in the
days of Elizabeth the East India Company
had fought with Dutch and Portuguese rivals
for control of its commerce. The English had
protected Persia, suppressed piracy and slavery,
and introduced sanitary measures in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
marshes along the coast. They regarded a
control of the Persian Gulf as necessary for
the prosperity of India and the Empire. The
Turkish Government had never had great
power along the Persian Gulf. Bagdad, indeed,
had been captured by Suleiman the
Magnificent in the sixteenth century, but in
eastern Arabia lived many independent Arabian
chieftains who had no idea of subjecting
themselves to Turkish rule.</p>

<p>For years Germany had been looking with
jealous eyes in this direction. Her elaborate
intrigues with Turkey were mainly designed
to open up the way to the Persian Gulf. She
had planned a great railway to open up trade,
and her endeavor to build the Bagdad Railway
is a story in itself. Her efforts had lasted for
many years, but she found herself constantly
blocked by the agents of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Before the Ottoman troops were ready, the
British in the Gulf had made a start. On
November 7th a British force under Brigadier-General
Delamain bombarded the Turkish
fort at Falon, landed troops and occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the village. Sailing north from this point
they disembarked at Sanijah, where they entrenched
themselves and waited for reinforcements.
On November 13th reinforcements arrived,
and on November 17th the British army
advanced toward Sahain. From there they
moved on Sahil, where they encountered a
Turkish force. Some lively fighting ensued
and the Turks broke and fled. Turkish casualties
were about one thousand five hundred
men, the English killed numbered thirty-eight.</p>

<p>The British then moved on Basra, moving by
steamer along the Shat-el-Arab River. On
November 22d Basra was reached and it was
found that the Turks had evacuated the place.
A base camp was then prepared, for it was certain
that there would be further fighting.
Bagdad was only about three hundred miles
distant; and fifty miles above Basra, at the
junction of the Tigris and the Euphrates, lies
the town of Kurna where the Turks were gathering
an army. On December 4th an attack
was made on Kurna but without success. The
British obtained reinforcements, but on December<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
9th the Turkish garrison surrendered
unconditionally. The British troops then
entrenched themselves, having established a
barricade against a hostile advance upon
India.</p>

<p>Farther north the war was between Turkey
and Russia. Since Persia had no military
power, each combatant was able to occupy
that country whenever they desired. The
Turks advanced into Persia south of Lake
Urmia, and, meeting with no resistance from
Persia, moved northward toward the Russian
frontier. On the 30th of January, 1915, Russian
troops heavily defeated the invaders and
followed them south as far as Tabriz, which
they occupied and held. The Russian armies
had also undertaken movements in this section.
In the extreme northwest of Persia a Russian
column had crossed the frontier, and occupied,
on the 3d of November, the town of Bayazid
close to Mt. Ararat. Other columns entered
Kurdestan, and an expedition against Van was
begun. Further north another Russian column
crossed the frontier and captured the town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of Karakilissa, but was held there by the
Turks.</p>

<p>These were minor expeditions. The real
struggle was in Transcaucasia, where the main
body of the Turkish army under Enver Pasha
himself was in action. At this point the
boundaries of Turkey touch upon the Russian
Empire. To the north is the Great Russian
fortress of Kars, to the south and west
the Turkish stronghold of Erzerum. The
whole district is a great mountain tangle, the
towns standing at an altitude of 5,000 and
6,000 feet, surrounded by lofty hills. None
of the roads are good, and in winter the passes
are almost impassable. In all the wars between
Russia and Turkey, these mountain regions
have been the scenes of desperate battles.</p>

<p>The Turkish plan of battle was to entice
the Russians from Sarakamish across the frontier,
leading them on to some distance from
their base, then, while holding their front, a
second force was to swing around and attack
them on the left flank. The plan was simple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the difficulty was the swing of the left flank,
which had to be made through mountain paths,
deeply covered with snow. The Turkish army
was composed of about 150,000 men under the
command of Hassan Izzet Pasha, but Enver,
with a large German staff, was the true commander.
The Russian army, under General
Woronzov was about 100,000 men.</p>

<p>Early in November the Russians crossed the
frontier and reached Koprikeui, which they
occupied on the 20th of November. The
Turkish Eleventh corps was entrusted with the
duty of holding the Russian forces; the remainder
of the army was to advance over the
passes and take their stations behind the Russian
right. On December 25th the Turkish
attack began. The Eleventh corps forced
back the Russians from Koprikeui to Khorasan,
while the extreme Turkish left was endeavoring
to outflank them. But the weather
was desperate. A blizzard was sweeping
down the steeps. The Turkish forces were
indeed able to carry out the plan, for they obtained
the position desired. But by this time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
they were worn out, and half starved, and
their attack on New Year’s Day resulted in
their defeat and retreat. The Ninth corps
was utterly wiped out, and the remainder of
the Turkish forces driven off in confusion.
Only the strenuous efforts of the Turkish
Eleventh corps prevented a debacle. After a
three days’ battle it, too, was broken, and with
heavy losses it retreated toward Erzerum.
The snowdrifts and blizzards must have accounted
for not less than 50,000 of the Turkish
troops. The result of the battle made Russia
safe in the Caucasus.</p>

<p>But the Germans had another use for the
Turkish forces. England was in control of
Egypt and the Suez Canal. The German
view of England’s position has been well
stated by Dr. Paul Rohrbach:</p>

<p>“As soon as England acquired Egypt it
was incumbent upon her to guard against any
menace from Asia. Such a danger apparently
arose when Turkey, weakened by her last war
with Russia and by difficult conditions at home,
began to turn to Germany for support. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
now war has come, and England is reaping the
crops which she has sown. England, not we,
desired this war. She knows this, despite all
her hypocritical talk, and she fears that, as
soon as connection is established along the
Berlin-Vienna-Budapest-Sofia-Constantinople
Line, the fate of Egypt may be decided.
Through the Suez Canal goes the route to all
the lands surrounding the Indian Ocean, and
by way of Singapore to the western shores of
the Pacific. These two worlds together have
about nine hundred million inhabitants, more
than half the population of the universe, and
India lies in a controlling position in their
midst. Should England lose the Suez Canal
she will be obliged, unlike the powers in control
of that waterway, to use the long route
around the Cape of Good Hope, and depend
on the good will of the South African Boers.
The majority among the latter have not the
same views as Botha. However, it is too early
to prophesy, and it is not according to German
ideas to imitate our opponents by singing premature
paeons of victory. But anyhow we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
well aware why anxious England already sees
us on the road to India.”</p>

<p>Following out this view a Turkish force was
directed toward the Suez Canal, while the
German intriguers did their best to stir up
revolt in Egypt itself. The story of Egypt
is one of the most interesting parts of the
world’s history. In the early days of the
world it led mankind. Its peculiar geographical
position at first gave it strength, and afterward
made it the prize for which all nations
were ready to contend. In 1517 the Sultan
Selim conquered Egypt and made it part of
the Turkish realm, and in spite of many
changes the sovereignty of Constantinople had
continued. In recent years the misgovernment
of the Khedive Ismael had brought into
its control France and Britain; then came the
deposition of Ismael, the revolt under Arabi,
the bombardment of Alexandria and the battle
of Tel-el-Kebir. Since then Egypt has been
occupied by Great Britain, who restored order,
defeated the armies of the Mahdi, and turned
Egyptian bankruptcy into prosperity. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Kitchener was the English hero of the wars
with the Mahdi, and the Lord Cromer the administrator
who gave the Egyptian peasant a
comfort unknown since the days of the Pharaohs.
With prosperity came political agitation,
and Germany, as has been seen, looked
upon Egypt as fertile territory for German
propaganda.</p>

<p>Intrigue having failed in Egypt, a Turkish
force was directed against the Suez Canal. If
that could be captured Great Britain could be
cut off from India. An expeditionary army
of about 65,000 men was gathered under the
command of Djemal Pasha, the former Turkish
Minister of Marine. He had been bitterly
indignant at the seizure of the two Turkish
dreadnoughts building in England, and was
burning for revenge. But he found great difficulties
before him. To reach the Canal it
was necessary to cross a trackless desert, varying
from 120 to 150 miles in width. Over this
desert there were three routes. The first
touched the Mediterranean coast at El-Arish
and then went across the desert to El-Kantara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
on the Canal, twenty-five miles south of Port
Said. On this route there were only a few
wells, quite insufficient for an army. A second
route ran from Akaba, on the Red Sea, across
the Peninsula of Sinai to a point a little north
of Suez. This was also badly supplied with
wells. Between the two was the central route.
Leaving the Mediterranean at El-Arish it ran
up the valley called the Wady El-Arish to
where that valley touched the second road.
There was no railway, nor were these roads
suitable for motor transports; for an army to
move it would be necessary either to build a
railway or to improve the roads. The best
route for railway was the Wady El-Arish.
The Suez Canal, moreover, can be easily defended.
It is over two hundred feet wide, with
banks rising to a height of forty feet. A railway
runs along the whole Canal, and most of
the ground to the east is flat, offering a good
field of fire either to troops on the banks or to
ships on the Canal.</p>

<p>A considerable force of British troops, under
the command of Major-General Sir John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Maxwell, were assigned for the protection of
the Canal. About the end of October it was
reported that 2,000 Bedouins were marching
on the Canal, and on November 21st a skirmish
took place between this force and some of the
English troops in which the Bedouins were repelled.
Nothing more was heard for more
than two months, but on January 28, 1915, a
small advance party from the Turkish army
was beaten back east of El-Kantara. British
airmen watched the desert well, and kept the
British army well informed of the Turkish
movements. The Turks had found it impossible
to convey their full force across the desert,
and the forces which finally arrived seemed to
have numbered only about twelve thousand
men. The main attack was not developed until
February 2d.</p>

<p>According to an account in the London
<i>Times</i>, on that date, the enemy began to move
toward the Ismailia Ferry. They met a reconnoitering
party of Indian troops of all arms,
and a desultory engagement ensued to which
a violent sandstorm put a sudden end about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
three o’clock in the afternoon. The main attacking
force pushed forward toward its destination
after nightfall. From twenty-five to
thirty galvanized iron pontoon boats, seven and
a half meters in length, which had been dragged
in carts across the desert, were hauled by hand
toward the water. With one or two rafts made
of kerosene tins in a wooden frame, all was
ready for the attack. The first warning of
the enemy’s approach was given by a sentry of
a mountain battery who heard, to him, an unknown
tongue across the water. The noise
soon increased. It would seem that Mudjah
Ideem—“Holy Warriors”—said to be mostly
old Tripoli fighters, accompanied the pontoon
section, and regulars of the Seventy-fifth regiment,
for loud exultations, often in Arabic, of
“Brothers, die for the faith; we can die but
once,” betrayed the enthusiastic irregular.</p>

<p>The Egyptians waited until the Turks were
pushing their boats into the water, then the
Maxims attached to the battery suddenly
spoke, and the guns opened at point-blank
range at the men and boats crowded under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
steep bank opposite them. Immediately a violent
fire broke out on both sides of the Canal.</p>

<p>A little torpedo boat with a crew of thirteen,
patrolling the Canal, dashed up and landed a
party of four officers and men to the south of
Tussum, who climbed up the eastern bank and
found themselves in a Turkish trench, and escaped
by a miracle with the news. Promptly
the midget dashed in between the fires and enfiladed
the eastern bank amid a hail of bullets,
and destroyed several pontoon boats lying unlaunched
on the bank. It continued to harass
the enemy, though two officers and two men
were wounded.</p>

<p>As the dark, cloudy night lightened toward
dawn fresh forces went into action. The
Turks, who occupied the outer, or day, line of
the Tussum post, advanced, covered by artillery,
against the Indian troops, holding the
inner or night position, while an Arab regiment
advanced against the Indian troop at the Serapeum
post. The warships on the Canal and
lake joined in the fray. The enemy brought
some six batteries of field guns into action from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the slopes west of Kataiba-el-kaeli. Shells
admirably fused made fine practice at all the
visible targets, but failed to find the battery
above mentioned, which, with some help from
a detachment of infantry, beat down the fire of
the riflemen on the opposite bank and inflicted
heavy losses on the hostile supports advancing
toward the Canal.</p>

<p>Supported by land and naval artillery the
Indian troops took the offensive, the Serapeum
garrison, which had stopped the enemy three-quarters
of a mile from the position, cleared its
front, and the Tussum garrison, by a brilliant
counter-attack, drove the enemy back. Two
battalions of Anatolians of the Twenty-eighth
regiment were thrown into the fight, but the
artillery gave them no chance, and by 3.30 in
the afternoon a third of the enemy, with the
exception of a force that lay hid in bushy hollows
on the east bank between the two posts,
were in full retreat, leaving many dead, a large
proportion of whom had been killed by shrapnel.
Meanwhile the warships on the lake had
been in action, a salvo from a battleship woke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
up Ismailia early, and crowds of soldiers and
some civilians climbed every available sand hill
to see what was doing, till the Turkish guns
sent shells sufficiently near to convince them
that it was safer to watch from cover.</p>

<p>At about eleven in the morning two six-inch
shells hit the Hardinge near the southern entrance
of the lake. They first damaged the
funnel, and the second burst inboard. Pilot
Carew, a gallant old merchant seaman, refused
to go below when the firing opened and
lost a leg. Nine others were wounded, one or
two merchantmen were hit but no lives were
lost. A British gunboat was struck. Then
came a dramatic duel between the Turkish big
gun, or guns, and a warship. The Turks fired
just over, and then just short, at 9,000 yards.
The warship sent in a salvo of more six-inch
shells than had been fired that day.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the 3d there was
sniping from the east bank between Tussum
and Serapeum, and a man was killed on the
tops of a British battleship. Next morning
the sniping was renewed and the Indian troops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
moving out to search the ground, found several
hundred of the enemy in the hollow previously
mentioned. During the fight some of the enemy,
either by accident or design, held up their
hands, while others fired on the Punjabis, who
were advancing to take the surrender, and
killed a British officer. A sharp fight with the
cold steel followed, and a British officer killed
a Turkish officer with a sword thrust in single
combat. A body of a German officer with a
white flag was afterward found here, but there
is no proof that the white flag was used. Finally
all the enemy were killed, captured or put
to flight. With this the fighting ended, and
the subsequent operations were confined to the
rounding up of prisoners, and the capture of a
considerable amount of military material left
behind. The Turks, who departed with their
guns and baggage during the night of the 3d,
still seemed to be moving eastward.</p>

<p>So ended the battle of the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>Two more incidents in the Turkish campaign
remain to be noticed. Report having
come that the town of Akaba on the Red Sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
was being used as a mine-laying station, H. M.
S. Minerva visited the place, and found it occupied
by soldiers under a German officer.
The Minerva destroyed the fort and the barracks
and the government buildings. Another
British cruiser, with a detachment of Indian
troops, captured the Turkish fort at Sheik
Said, at the southern end of the Red Sea.
And so for the time ended all Turkish movements
against Great Britain. That such
movements should have been possible seems
hard to believe. For a century the British had
been the friends and allies of the Turkish Government.
In the Crimean War their armies
had fought side by side with the Turkish troops
against Russia. In the Russo-Turkish War
Lord Beaconsfield, in the negotiations which
preceded the treaty of Berlin, had saved for
Turkey much of its territory. It was only the
British influence and the fear of the British
power which had prevented Russia from taking
possession of Constantinople a half a century
before. The English had always been
popular in Turkey and there was every reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
at the beginning of the war to believe that their
popularity had not waned. There is reason to
believe that the average Turk had little sympathy
with the course of his government, and
if a free expression of the popular will had
been possible the Turkish army would never
have been sent against either the Englishmen
or the Frenchmen. But long years of German
propaganda had done their work. The
power of Enver Pasha was greater than that
of the weakling Sultan and the war was forced
upon the Turkish people by German tools and
German bribes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<span class="smcap">Rescue of the Starving</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sufferings of Belgium during the German
occupation were terrible, and attracted
the attention and the sympathy of the
whole world. To understand conditions it is
necessary to know something of the economic
situation. Since it had come under the protection
of the Great Powers, Belgium had developed
into one of the greatest manufacturing
countries in the world. Nearly two million of
her citizens were employed in the great industries,
and one million two hundred thousand on
the farms. She was peaceful, industrious and
happy. But on account of the fact that more
than one-half of her citizenship earned their
living by daily labor she found it impossible to
produce foodstuff enough for her own needs.
Seventy-eight per cent of her breadstuffs had
to be imported. From her own fields she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
hardly supply her population for more than
four months.</p>

<p>The war, and the German occupation, almost
destroyed business. Mines, workshops,
factories and mills were closed. Labor found
itself without employment and consequently
without wages. The banks would extend no
credit. But even if there had been money
enough it soon became apparent that the food
supply was rapidly going. The German invasion
had come when the crops were standing
ripe upon the field. Those crops had not been
reaped, but had been trampled under foot by
the hated German.</p>

<p>One feature of Belgian industrial life should
be understood. Hundreds of thousands of her
workmen were employed each day in workshops
at considerable distances from their own
homes. In times of peace the morning and
evening trains were always crowded with laborers
going to and returning from their daily
toil. One of the first things seized upon by
the German officials was the railroads, and it
was with great difficulty that anyone, not belonging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
to the German army, could obtain an
opportunity to travel at all, and it was with
still greater difficulty that supplies of food of
any kind could be transported from place to
place. Every village was cut off from its
neighbor, every town from the next town.
People were unable even to obtain news of the
great political events which were occurring
from day to day, and the food supply was
automatically cut off.</p>

<p>But this was not the worst. One of the first
moves of the German occupation was to quarter
hundreds of thousands of troops upon their
Belgian victims, and these troops must be fed
even though the Belgian and his family were
near starvation. Then followed the German
seizure of what they called materials for war.
General von Beseler in a despatch to the
Kaiser, after the fall of Antwerp, speaks very
plainly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The war booty taken at Antwerp is enormous—at
least five hundred cannon and huge quantities of ammunition,
sanitation materials, high-power motor cars, locomotives,
wagons, four million kilograms of wheat, large
quantities of flour, coal and flax wool, the value of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
is estimated at ten million marks, copper, silver, one armored
train, several hospital trains, and quantities of
fish.</p>
</div>

<p>The Germans proceeded to commandeer
foodstuffs and raw materials of industry.
Linseed oil, oil cakes, nitrates, animal and vegetable
oils, petroleum and mineral oils, wool,
copper, rubber, ivory, cocoa, rice, wine, beer, all
were seized and sent home to the Fatherland.
Moreover, cities and provinces were burdened
with formidable war contributions. Brussels
was obliged to pay ten million dollars, Antwerp
ten million dollars, the province of Brabant,
ninety millions of dollars, Namur and
seventeen surrounding communes six million
four hundred thousand dollars. Finally Governor
von Bissing, on the 10th of December,
1914, issued the following decree:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A war contribution of the amount of eight million dollars
to be paid monthly for one year is imposed upon the
population of Belgium. The payment of these amounts
is imposed upon the nine provinces which are regarded
as joint debtors. The two first monthly payments are
to be made by the 15th of January, 1915, at latest, and
the following monthly payments by the tenth of each
following month to the military chest of the Field Army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
of the General Imperial Government in Brussels. If
the provinces are obliged to resort to the issue of stock
with a view to procuring the necessary funds, the form
and terms of these shares will be determined by the
Commissary General for the banks in Belgium.</p>
</div>

<p>At a meeting of the Provincial Councils the
vice-president declared: “The Germans demand
these $96,000,000 of the country without
right and without reason. Are we to sanction
this enormous war tax? If we listened only to
our hearts, we should reply ‘No! ninety-six
million times no!’ because our hearts would tell
us we were a small, honest nation living happily
by its free labor; we were a small, honest
nation having faith in treaties and believing in
honor; we were a nation unarmed, but full of
confidence, when Germany suddenly hurled
two million men upon our frontiers, the most
brutal army that the world has ever seen, and
said to us, ‘Betray the promise you have given.
Let my armies go by, that I may crush France,
and I will give you gold.’ Belgium replied,
‘Keep your gold. I prefer to die, rather than
live without honor.’ The German army has,
therefore, crushed our country in contempt of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
solemn treaties. ‘It is an injustice,’ said the
Chancellor of the German Empire. ‘The position
of Germany has forced us to commit it,
but we will repair the wrong we have done to
Belgium by the passage of our armies.’ They
want to repair the injustice as follows: Belgium
will pay Germany $96,000,000! Give
this proposal your vote. When Galileo had
discovered the fact that the earth moved
around the sun, he was forced at the foot of
the stake to abjure his error, but he murmured,
‘Nevertheless it moves.’ Well, gentlemen, as
I fear a still greater misfortune for my country
I consent to the payment of the $96,000,000
and I cry ‘Nevertheless it moves.’ Long live
our country in spite of all.”</p>

<p>At the end of a year von Bissing renewed
this assessment, inserting in his decree the
statement that the decree was based upon article
forty-nine of The Hague Convention, relating
to the laws and usages of war on land.
This article reads as follows: “If in addition
to the taxes mentioned in the above article the
occupant levies other moneyed contributions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the occupied territory, they shall only be applied
to the needs of the army, or of the administration,
of the territory in question.” In the
preceding article it says: “If in the territory
occupied the occupant collects the taxes, dues
and tolls payable to the state, he shall do so as
far as possible in accordance with the legal
basis and assessment in force at the time, and
shall in consequence be bound to defray the expenses
of the administration of the occupied
territories to the same extent as the National
Government had been so bound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>The $96,000,000 per annum was more than
six times the amount of the direct taxes formerly
collected by the Belgian state, taxes
which the German administration, moreover,
collected in addition to the war assessment.
It was five times as great as the ordinary expenditure
of the Belgian War Department.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Schleswig-Holstein and Alsace-Lorraine Acquisitions</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But this was not all. In addition to the
more or less legitimate German methods of
plunder the whole country had been pillaged.
In many towns systematic pillage began as
soon as the Germans took possession. At
Louvain the pillage began on the 27th of August,
1914, and lasted a week. In small bands
the soldiers went from house to house, ransacked
drawers and cupboards, broke open
safes, and stole money, pictures, curios, silver,
linen, clothing, wines, and food. Great loads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
of such plunder were packed on military baggage
wagons and sent to Germany. The same
conditions were reported from town after town.
In many cases the houses were burnt to destroy
the proof of extensive thefts.</p>

<p>Nor were these offenses committed only by
the common soldiers. In many cases the officers
themselves sent home great collections
of plunder. Even the Royal Family were
concerned in this disgraceful performance.
After staying for a week in a château in the
Liége District, His Imperial Highness, Prince
Eitel Fritz, and the Duke of Brunswick, had
all the dresses which were found in a wardrobe
sent back to Germany. This is said to be susceptible
of absolute proof.</p>

<p>In addition to this form of plunder special
pretexts were made use of to obtain money.
At Arlon a telephone wire was broken, whereupon
the town was given four hours to pay a
fine of $20,000 in gold, in default of which one
hundred houses would be sacked. When the
payment was made forty-seven houses had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
been plundered. Instance after instance
could be given of similar unjustifiable
and exorbitant fines.</p>

<p>Under treatment like this Belgium was
brought in a short time into immediate sight of
starvation. They made frantic appeals for
help. First they appealed to the Germans,
but the German authorities did nothing,
though in individual cases German soldiers
shared their army rations with the people.
Then an appeal was made to Holland, but
Holland was a nation much like Belgium. It
did not raise food enough for itself, and was not
sure that it could import enough for its own
needs.</p>

<p>From all over Belgium appeals were sent
from the various towns and villages to Brussels.
But Brussels, too, was face to face with
famine. To cope with famine there were
many relief organizations in Belgium. Every
little town had its relief committee, and in the
larger cities strong branches of the Red Cross
did what they could. Besides such secular organizations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
there were many religious organizations,
generally under the direction of the
Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p>In Brussels a strong volunteer relief organization
was formed on September 5th under
the patronage of the American and Spanish
Ministers, Mr. Brand Whitlock and the Marquis
of Villalobar. This committee, known as
the Central Relief Committee, or more exactly
La Comité Central de Secours et d’Alimentation
pour l’Agglomération bruxelloise, did
wonderful work until the end of the war. But
though there was plenty of organization there
were great difficulties ahead.</p>

<p>In order to import food, credit had to be
established abroad, permission had to be obtained
to transport foodstuffs into Belgium
through the British blockade. Permission to
use the railroads and canals of Belgium had to
be obtained from Germany, and, most important
of all, it had to be made certain that no food
thus imported should be seized by the German
troops.</p>

<p>Through the American and Spanish ministers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
permission was obtained from Governor-General
Kolmar von der Goltz to import food,
and the Governor-General also gave assurance
that, “Foodstuffs of all sorts imported by the
committee to assist the civil population shall be
reserved exclusively for the nourishment of the
civil population of Belgium, and that consequently
these foodstuffs shall be exempt from
requisition on the part of the military authorities,
and shall rest exclusively at the disposition
of the committee.”</p>

<p>With this assurance the Central Relief Committee
sent Emil Francqui and Baron Lambert,
members of their committee, together
with Mr. Hugh Gibson, secretary of the American
Legation, whose activities in behalf of Belgium
attracted much favorable notice, to the
city of London, to explain to the British Government
the suffering that existed in Belgium,
and to obtain permission to transport food
through the British blockade. In the course
of this work they appealed to the American
Ambassador in England, Mr. Walter Hines
Page, and were introduced by him to an American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
mining engineer named Herbert Clark
Hoover, who had just become prominent as the
chairman of a committee to assist Americans
who had found themselves in Europe when the
war broke out, and had been unable to secure
funds.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoover took up the matter with great
vigor, and organized an American committee
under the patronage of the ministers of the
United States and of Spain in London, Berlin,
The Hague and Brussels, which committee obtained
permission from the British Government
to purchase and transport through the
British blockade, to Rotterdam, Holland, cargoes
of foodstuffs, to be ultimately transferred
into Belgium and distributed by the Belgian
Central Relief Committee under the direction
of American citizens headed by Mr. Brand
Whitlock.</p>

<p>The following brief notices, in connection
with this committee appeared in the London
<i>Times</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>October 24, 1914.—A commission has been set up in
London, under the title of The American Commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
for Relief in Belgium. The Brussels committee reports
feeding 300,000 daily.</p>

<p>November 4.—The Commission for Relief in Belgium
yesterday issued their first weekly report, 3 London
Wall Buildings. A cargo was received yesterday
at Brussels just in time. Estimated monthly requirements,
60,000 tons grain, 15,000 tons maize, 3,000 tons
rice and peas. Approved by the Spanish and American
ministers, Brussels.</p>
</div>

<p>The personality of the various gentlemen
who devoted themselves to Belgian relief is interesting,
not only because of what they did,
but because they are unusual men. The Spanish
Minister, who bore the peculiar name of
Marquis of Villalobar y O’Neill, had the appearance
of an Irishman, as he was on the maternal
side, and was a trained diplomat, with
delightful manners and extraordinary strength
of character. Another important aid in the
Belgian relief work was the Mexican Chargé
d’Affaires Señor don German Bullé. Hugh
Gibson, secretary of the American Legation,
wittily described this gentleman as the “representative
of a country without a government
to a government without a country.” The
businessman in the American Legation was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
this secretary. Mr. Gibson had the appearance
of a typical Yankee, though he came from
Indiana. He was about thirty years old, with
dark eyes, crisp hair, and a keen face. He was
noted for his wit as well as his courage. Many
interesting stories are told of him. He had
been often under fire, and he was full of stories
of his exploits told in a witty and modest way.</p>

<p>The following incident shows something of
his humor. Like most of the Americans in
Belgium he was followed by spies. With one
of these Gibson became on the most familiar
terms, much to the spy’s disgust. One very
rainy day, when Gibson was at the Legation,
he discovered his pet spy standing under the
dripping eaves of a neighboring house. Gibson
picked up a raincoat and hurried over to
the man.</p>

<p>“Look here, old fellow,” said he, “I’m going
to be in the Legation for three hours. You
put on this coat and go home. Come back in
three hours and I’ll let you watch me for the
rest of the day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brand Whitlock, the American Minister,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
was a remarkable man. Before coming to
Belgium he had become a distinguished man of
letters. Beginning as a newspaper reporter in
Chicago, he had studied law and been admitted
to the Illinois Bar in 1894, and to the Bar of
the State of Ohio in 1897. He had entered
into politics, and been elected mayor of Toledo,
Ohio, in 1905, again in 1907, 1909 and
1911. Meanwhile he had been writing novels,
“The Thirteenth District,” “The Turn of the
Balance,” “The Fall Guy,” and “Forty Years
of It.” He had accepted the appointment of
American Minister to Belgium with the idea
that he would find leisure for other literary
work, but the outbreak of the war affected him
deeply. A man of a sympathetic character
who had lived all his life in an amiable atmosphere,
had been a member of prison reform
associations and charitable societies, he now
found himself surrounded by a storm of horrors.
Day by day he had to see the distress
and suffering of thousands of people. He
threw himself at once into the work of relief.
His health was not strong and he always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
looked tired and worn. He was the scholarly
type of man, the kind who would be happy in
a library, or in the atmosphere of a college, but
he rose to the emergency.</p>

<p>The American Legation became the one
staple point around which the starving and
suffering population could rally. Belgians
will never forget what he did in those days.
On Washington’s Birthday they filed before
the door of the American Legation at Number
74 Rue de Trèves, men, women and children of
all classes; some in furs, some in the garments
of the poor; noblemen, scholars, workmen, artists,
shopkeepers and peasants to leave their
visiting cards, some engraved, some printed
and some written on pieces of paper, in tribute
to Mr. Whitlock and the nation which he represented.</p>

<p>But the man whose name stands out above
all others as one of the biggest figures in connection
with the work of relief was Mr. Herbert
C. Hoover. Mr. Hoover came of Quaker
stock. He was born at West Branch, Iowa, in
1874, graduated from Leland Stanford University<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
in 1895, specialized in mining engineering,
and spent several years in mining in the
United States and in Australia. He married
Miss Lou Henry, of Monterey, California, in
1899, and with his bride went to China as chief
engineer of the Chinese Imperial Bureau of
Mines. He aided in the defense of Tientsin
during the Boxer Rebellion. After that he
continued engineering work in China until
1902, when he became a partner of the firm of
Bewick, Moreing &amp; Co., mine operators, of
London, and was consulting engineer for more
than fifty mining companies. He looked extremely
youthful; smooth shaven, with a
straight nose, and a strong mouth and chin.
To him, more than anyone else, was due the
creation and the success of the Commission for
Relief in Belgium. The splendid organization
which saved from so much suffering more
than seven million non-combatants in Belgium
and two million in Northern France, was his
achievement.</p>

<p>A good story is told in the <i>Outlook</i> of September
8, 1915, which illustrates his methods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
It seems that before the commission was fairly
on its feet, there came a day when it was a case
of snarling things in red tape and letting Belgium
starve, or getting food shipped and letting
governments howl. Hoover naturally
chose the latter.</p>

<p>When the last bag had been stowed and the
hatches were battened down (writes Mr. Lewis
R. Freeman, who tells the story), Hoover went
in person to the one Cabinet Minister able to
arrange for the only things he could not provide
for himself—clearance papers.</p>

<p>“If I do not get four cargoes of food to Belgium
by the end of the week,” he said bluntly,
“thousands are going to die from starvation,
and many more may be shot in food riots.”</p>

<p>“Out of the question,” said the distinguished
Minister; “there is no time, in the first place,
and if there was, there are no good wagons to
be spared by the railways, no dock hands, and
no steamers. Moreover, the Channel is closed
for a week to merchant vessels, while troops are
being transferred to the Continent.”</p>

<p>“I have managed to get all these things,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Hoover replied quietly, “and am now through
with them all, except the steamers. This wire
tells me that these are now loaded and ready to
sail, and I have come to have you arrange for
their clearance.”</p>

<p>The great man gasped. “There have been—there
are even now—men in the Tower for
less than you have done!” he ejaculated. “If
it was for anything but Belgian Relief—if it
was anybody but you, young man—I should
hate to think of what might happen. As it is—er—I
suppose there is nothing to do but congratulate
you on a jolly clever coup. I’ll see
about the clearance at once.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George tells the following story:
It seems that the Commission on Belgian Relief
was attempting to simplify its work by
arranging for an extension of exchange facilities
on Brussels. Mr. Lloyd George, then
Chancellor of the Exchequer, sent for Hoover.
What happened is told in Mr. George’s
words.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Hoover,’ I said, ‘I find I am quite
unable to grant your request in the matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Belgian exchange, and I have asked you to
come here that I might explain why.’</p>

<p>“Without waiting for me to go on, my boyish-looking
caller began speaking. For fifteen
minutes he spoke without a break—just
about the clearest expository utterance I have
ever heard on any subject. He used not a
word too much, nor yet a word too few. By
the time he had finished I had come to realize,
not only the importance of his contentions, but,
what was more to the point, the practicability
of granting his request. So I did the only
thing possible under the circumstance, told him
I had never understood the question before,
thanked him for helping me to understand, and
saw to it that things were arranged as he
wanted them.”</p>

<p>On April 10, 1915, a submarine torpedoed
one of the food ships chartered by the commission.
A week later a German hydro-airplane
tried to drop bombs on the deck of another
commission ship. So Hoover paid a flying
visit to Berlin. He was at once assured that
no more incidents of the sort would occur.</p>

<p>Food ships successfully convoyed by seaplanes in clear weather when submarines
were easier to detect.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Thanks,” said Hoover. “Your Excellency,
have you heard the story of the man who
was nipped by a bad-tempered dog? He went
to the owner to have the dog muzzled. ‘But
the dog won’t bite you,’ insisted the owner.
‘You know he won’t bite me, and I know he
won’t bite me,’ said the injured party doubtfully,
‘but the question is, does the dog
know?’”</p>

<p>“Herr Hoover,” said the high official, “pardon
me if I leave you for a moment. I am going
at once to ‘let the dog know.’”</p>

<p>This story, which is told by Mr. Edward
Eyre Hunt in his delightful book about Belgium,
“War Bread,” may be apocryphal, but
it illustrates well Hoover’s habit of getting exactly
what he wants.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hoover accepted the chairmanship
of the Commission for Relief in Belgium
he established his headquarters at 3 London
Wall Buildings, London, England, and
marshaled a small legion of fellow Americans,
business men, sanitary experts, doctors and
social workers, who, as unpaid volunteers, set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
about the great task of feeding the people of
Belgium and Northern France. The commission
soon became a great institution, recognized
by all governments, receiving contributions
from all parts of the earth, with its own ships in
every big port, and in the eyes of the Belgians
and French, who received their daily bread
through its agency, a monument of what
Americans could do in social organization and
business efficiency, for Americans furnished
the entire personnel of the commission from
the beginning.</p>

<p>The commission was a distinct organization
from the Belgian National Committee,
through and with which it worked in Belgium
itself. Its functions were those of direction,
and supervision of all matters that had to be
dealt with outside Belgium. In the occupied
territories it had the help of thousands of Belgian
and French workers, many of them
women.</p>

<p>The commission did not depend, according
to Mr. Hoover, on any one of its American
members for leadership. Any one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
could at any time take charge and carry on the
work. “Honold, Poland, Gregory, Brown,
Kellogg, Lucey, White, Hunsiker, Connet,
and many others who, at various periods, have
given of their great ability and experience in
administration could do it.” At the same time
it was admitted that the commission would
never have been so successful if Belgium had
not already had in existence a well-developed
communal system. The base of the commission’s
organization was a committee in every
commune or municipality.</p>

<p>“You can have no idea what a great blessing
it was in Belgium and Northern France to
have the small and intimate divisions which
exist under the communal system,” said Mr.
Hoover. “It is the whole unit of life, and a
political entity much more developed than in
America. It has been not only the basis of our
relief organization, but the salvation of the
people.”</p>

<p>Altogether there were four thousand communal
committees, linked up in larger groups
under district and provincial committees, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
in turn came under the Belgian National Committee.
Contributions were received from all
over the world, but the greater part from the
British and French governments.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hoover began his work he appealed
to the people of the United States, but
the American response to the appeal was sadly
disappointing. During his stay in America,
in the early part of 1917, Mr. Hoover expressed
himself on the subject of his own country’s
niggardliness, pointing out at the same
time that the chief profits made out of providing
food for Belgium had gone into American
pockets. Out of the two hundred and fifty
millions of dollars spent by the commission at
that time, one hundred and fifty millions had
been used in the United States to purchase supplies
and on these orders America had made a
war profit of at least thirty million dollars.
Yet in those two years the American people
had contributed only nine million dollars!</p>

<p>Mr. Hoover declared: “Thousands of contributions
have come to us from devoted people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
all over the United States, but the truth is that,
with the exception of a few large gifts, American
contributions have been little rills of charity
of the poor toward the poor. Everywhere
abroad America has been getting the credit for
keeping alight the lamp of humanity, but what
are the facts? America’s contributions have
been pitifully inadequate and, do not forget it,
other peoples have begun to take stock of us.
We have been getting all the credit. Have
we deserved it? We lay claim to idealism, to
devotion to duty and to great benevolence, but
now the acid test is being applied to us. This
has a wider import than mere figures. Time
and time again, when the door to Belgium
threatened to close, we have defended its portals
by the assertion that this was an American
enterprise; that the sensibilities of the American
people would be wounded beyond measure,
would be outraged, if this work were interfered
with. Our moral strength has been
based upon this assertion. I believe it is true,
but it is difficult in the face of the figures to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
carry conviction. And in the last six or eight
months time and again we have felt our influence
slip from under us.”</p>

<p>The statement that Germans had taken food
intended for the Belgians was disposed of by
Mr. Hoover in a speech in New York City.
“We are satisfied,” he said, “that the German
army has never eaten one-tenth of one per cent
of the food provided. The Allied governments
never would have supplied us with two
hundred million dollars if we were supplying
the German army. If the Germans had absorbed
any considerable quantity of this food
the population of Belgium would not be alive
today.”</p>

<p>The plan of operation of the Belgian Commission
needs some description. Besides the
headquarters in London there was an office in
Brussels, and, as Rotterdam was the port of
entry for all Belgian supplies, a transshipping
office for commission goods was opened in that
city. The office building was at 98 Haringvliet,
formerly the residence of a Dutch merchant
prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Captain J. F. Lucey, the first Rotterdam director,
sat in a roomy office on the second floor
overlooking the Meuse. From his windows he
could see the commission barges as they left for
Belgium, their huge canvas flags bearing the
inscription “Belgian Relief Committee.” He
was a nervous, big, beardless American, a volunteer
who had left his business to organize
and direct a great transshipping office in an
alien land for an alien people.</p>

<p>Out of nothing he created a large staff of
clerks, wrung from the Dutch Government
special permits, loaded the immense cargoes received
from England into canal boats, obtained
passports for cargoes and crews, and shipped
the foodstuffs consigned personally to Mr.
Brand Whitlock.</p>

<p>Something of what was done at this point
may be understood from a reference in the first
annual report of the commission published
October 31, 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chartering and management of an entire fleet
of vessels, together with agency control practically
throughout the world, has been carried out for the commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
quite free of the usual charges by large transportation
firms who offered these concessions in the
cause of humanity. Banks generally have given their
exchange services and have paid the full rate of interest
on deposits. Insurance has been facilitated by the
British Government Insurance Commissioners, and the
firms who fixed the insurance have subscribed the
equivalent of their fees. Harbor dues and port charges
have been remitted at many points and stevedoring firms
have made important concessions in rates and have afforded
other generous services. In Holland, exemption
from harbor dues and telegraph tolls has been granted
and rail transport into Belgium provided free of charge.
The total value of these Dutch concessions is estimated
at 147,824 guilders. The German military authorities
in Belgium have abolished custom and canal duties on
all commission imports, have reduced railway rates one-half
and on canals and railways they give right of way
to commission foodstuffs wherever there is need.</p>
</div>

<p>By mid-November gift ships from the
United States were on their way to Rotterdam,
but the Canadian province of Nova Scotia was
first in the transatlantic race.</p>

<p>One of the most thrilling experiences of the
first year’s work was the coming of the Christmas
ship, a steamer full of Christmas gifts presented
by the children of America to the children
of war-ridden Belgium. The children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
knew all about it long before the ship arrived
in Rotterdam. St. Nicholas’ day had brought
them few presents. They were hungry for
friendliness, and the thought of getting gifts
from children across the sea filled them with
joy.</p>

<p>Many difficulties arose, which delayed the
distribution of these gifts. The Germans insisted
that every package should be opened and
every scrap of writing taken out before the
gifts were sent into Belgium. This was a tremendous
task, for notes written by American
children were tucked away into all sorts of
places.</p>

<p>Three motor boats made an attempt to carry
these gifts into Belgium by Christmas day.
They carried boxes of clothing, outfits for
babies, blankets, caps, bonnets, cloaks, shoes of
every description, babies’ boots, candy, fish,
striped candy canes, chocolates and mountains
of nuts, nuts such as the Belgians had never
seen in their lives before: pecans, hickory
nuts, American walnuts, and peanuts galore.
There were scores of dolls, French bisques,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
smiling pleasantly, pop-eyed rag dolls, old
darky mammy dolls, and Santa Clauses, picture
books, fairy books and story books.</p>

<p>One child had written on the cover of her
book: “Father says I ought to send you my
best picture book, but I think that this one will
do.”</p>

<p>These gifts made the American aid to Belgium
a thousand times more intimate and real,
and never after that was American help
thought of in other terms than those of burning
gratitude. Among these gifts were hundreds
of American flags, which soon became familiar
to all Belgium.</p>

<p>The commission automobiles bore the flag,
and the children would recognize the Stars and
Stripes and wave and cheer as it went by.
Thousands upon thousands of gifts to the Belgian
people followed the Christmas ship. All,
or a great part, of the cargoes of one hundred
and two ships consisted of gift goods from
America and indeed from all parts of the
world, and the Belgians sent back a flood of
acknowledgments and thousands of beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
souvenirs. Some of the most touching remembrances
came from the children. Every child
in the town of Tamise, for example, wrote a
letter to America.</p>

<p>One addressed to the President of the
United States reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Highly Honored Mr. President: Although I am still
very young I feel already that feeling of thankfulness
which we, as Belgians, owe to you, Highly Honored
Mr. President, because you have come to our help in
these dreary times. Without your help there would
certainly have been thousands of war victims, and so,
Noble Sir, I pray that God will bless you and all the
noble American people. That is the wish of all the
Belgian folk.</p>
</div>

<p>On New Year’s day Cardinal Mercier,
Archbishop of Malines, issued his famous pastoral:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Belgium gave her word of honor to defend her independence.
She has kept her word. The other powers
had agreed to protect and to respect Belgium’s neutrality.
Germany has broken her word, England has been
faithful to it. These are the facts. I consider it an
obligation of my pastoral charge to define to you your
conscientious duties toward the power which has invaded
our soil, and which for the moment occupies the greater
part of it. This power has no authority, and therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
in the depth of your heart, you should render it neither
esteem, nor attachment, nor respect. The only legitimate
power in Belgium is that which belongs to our
King, to his government, to the representatives of the
nation; that alone is authority for us; that alone has a
right to our heart’s affection and to our submission.</p>
</div>

<p>Cardinal Mercier was called the bravest man
in Belgium. Six feet five in height, a thin,
scholarly face, with grayish white hair, and a
forehead so white that one feels one looks on
the naked bone, he presented the appearance
of some medieval ascetic. But there was a
humorous look about his mouth, and an expression
of sympathy and comprehension which
gave the effect of a keenly intelligent, as well
as gentle, leader of the nation.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war the Roman
Catholic party was divided. Some of its leaders
were opposed to resistance to the invaders.
Many priests fled before the German armies.
But the pastoral letter of Cardinal Mercier restored
to the Church its old leadership. In
him conquered Belgium had found a voice.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Sunday, 1915, every priest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
at the Mass read out the Cardinal’s ringing
challenge. There were German soldiers in
the churches, but no word of the letter had
been allowed to reach the ears of the authorities,
and the Germans were taken completely
by surprise. Immediately orders came from
headquarters prohibiting further circulation of
the letter, and ordering that every copy should
be surrendered to the authorities. Soldiers
at the bayonet’s point extorted the letter from
the priests, and those who had read it were
put under arrest. Yet, somehow, copies of
the letter were circulated throughout Belgium,
and every Belgian took new heart.</p>

<p>As far as the Cardinal was concerned German
action was a very delicate matter. They
could not arrest and imprison so great a dignitary
of the Church for fear of the effect,
not only upon the Catholics of the outer world,
but on the Catholics in their own Empire.
An officer was sent to the Cardinal to demand
that the letter be recalled. The Cardinal refused.
He was then notified that it was desired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
that he remain in his palace for the
present. His confinement lasted only for a
day.</p>

<p>The Americans who were in Belgium as
representatives of the Relief Commission had
two duties. First, to see that the Germans
did not seize any of the food supplies, and
second, to see that every Belgian who was in
need should receive his daily bread. The
ration assigned to each Belgian was 250 grams
of bread per day. This seems rather small,
but the figure was established by Horace
Fletcher, the American food expert, who was
one of the members of the commission.</p>

<p>Mr. Fletcher also prepared a pamphlet on
food values, which gave recipes for American
dishes which were up to that time unknown
to the Belgians. He soon got not only the
American but the Belgian committeemen talking
of calories with great familiarity.</p>

<p>Some of the foods sent from America were
at first almost useless to the Belgians. They
did not know how to cook cornmeal and oatmeal,
and some of the famished peasants used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
them as feed for chickens. Teachers had to
be sent out through the villages to give instructions.</p>

<p>A great deal of difficulty developed in connection
with the bread. The supply of white
flour was limited; wheat had to be imported,
and milled in Belgium. It was milled so as
to contain all the bran except ten per cent,
but in some places ten or fifteen per cent of
cornmeal was added to the flour, not only to
enable the commission to provide the necessary
ration, but also to keep down the price. As
a result the price of bread was always lower
in Belgium than in London, Paris or New
York.</p>

<p>Much less trouble occurred in connection
with the distribution of bread and soup from
the soup kitchens. In Antwerp thirty-five
thousand men were fed daily at these places.
At first it often occurred that soup could be
had, but no bread. The ration of soup and
bread given in the kitchens cost about ten cents
a day. There were four varieties of soup, pea,
bean, vegetable and bouillon, and it was of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
excellent quality. Every person carried a
card with blank spaces for the date of the deliveries
of soup. There were several milk
kitchens maintained for the children, and several
restaurants where persons with money
might obtain their food.</p>

<p>It was necessary not only to fight starvation
in Belgium but also disease. There were epidemics
of typhoid and black measles. The
Rockefeller Foundation established a station
in Rotterdam called the Rockefeller Foundation
War Relief Commission, and some of the
women among its workers acted as volunteer
health officers. People were inoculated against
typhoid, and the sources of infection traced
and destroyed. Another form of relief work
was providing labor for the unemployed. A
plan of relief was drawn up and it was arranged
that a large portion of them should
be employed by the communal organizations,
in public works, such as draining, ditching, constructing
bridges and embankments and building
sewers.</p>

<p>The National Committee paid nine-tenths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the wages, the commune paying the other
tenth. The first enrolment of unemployed
amounted to more than 760,000 names, and
nearly as many persons were dependent upon
these workers.</p>

<p>Providing employment for these led to certain
complications. The Germans had been
able up to this time to secure a certain amount
of labor from the Belgians. Now the Belgian
could refuse to work for the German, and a
great deal of tact was necessary to prevent
trouble. As time went on the relief work of
the commission was extended into the north
of France, where a population of more than
2,000,000 was within the German zone. The
work was handled in the same way, with the
same guarantees from Germany.</p>

<p>In conclusion a word may be said of the
effect of all this suffering upon the Belgian
people, and let a Belgian speak, who knew
his country well and had traveled it over, going
on foot, as he says, or by tram, from town to
town, from village to village:</p>

<p>“I have seen and spoken with hundreds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
men of all classes and all parts of the country,
and all these people, taken singly or united in
groups, display a very definite frame of mind.
To describe this new psychology we must
record the incontestably closer union which
has been formed between the political sections
of the country. There are no longer any political
parties, there are Belgians in Belgium,
and that is all; Belgians better acquainted with
their country, feeling for it an impulse of passionate
tenderness such as a child might feel
who saw his mother suffering for the first
time, and on his account. Walloons and
Flemings, Catholics and Liberals or Socialists,
all are more and more frankly united in all
that concerns the national life and decisions
for the future.</p>

<p>“By uniting the whole nation and its army,
by shedding the blood of all our Belgians in
every corner of the country, by forcing all
hearts, all families, to follow with anguish the
movement of those soldiers who fought from
Liége to Namur, from Wavre to Antwerp or
the Oise, the war has suddenly imposed wider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
horizons upon all, has inspired all minds with
noble and ardent passions, has compelled the
good will of all to combine and act in concert
in order to defend the common interests.</p>

<p>“Of these profoundly tried minds, of these
wonderful energies now employed for the first
time, of these atrocious sufferings which have
brought all hearts into closer contact, a new
Belgium is born, a greater, more generous,
more ideal Belgium.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<span class="smcap">Britannia Rules the Waves</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE month of October, 1914, contained no
important naval contests. On the 15th,
the old British cruiser Hawke was torpedoed
in the North Sea and nearly five hundred men
were lost. On the other hand, on the 17th
of October, the light cruiser Undaunted, accompanied
by the destroyers, Lance, Legion
and Loyal, sank four German destroyers off
the Dutch coast. But the opening of November
turned the interest of the navy to the
Southern Pacific. When the war began Admiral
von Spee, with the German Pacific
squadron, was at Kiaochau in command of
seven vessels. Among these was the Emden,
whose adventurous career has been already described.
Another, the Karlsruhe, became a
privateer in the South Atlantic.</p>

<p>Early in August Von Spee set sail from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Kiaochau with two armored cruisers, the
Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst and three light
cruisers, the Dresden, Leipzig and Nurmberg.
These ships were comparatively new, well
armed, and of considerable speed. They set
off for the great trade highways to destroy, as
far as possible, British commerce. Their
route led them to the western coast of South
America, and arrangements were made so that
they were coaled and provisioned from bases
in some of the South American states which
permitted a slack observance of the laws respecting
the duties of neutrals.</p>

<p>A small British squadron had been detailed
to protect British commerce in this part of
the world. It was commanded by Rear-Admiral
Sir Christopher Cradock, a distinguished
and popular sailor, who had under his command
one twelve-year-old battleship, the Canopus,
two armored cruisers, the Good Hope
and the Monmouth, the light cruiser Glasgow,
and an armed liner, the Otranto. None of
these vessels had either great speed or heavy
armament. The equipment of the Canopus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
indeed, was obsolete. Admiral Cradock’s
squadron arrived at Halifax on August 14th,
thence sailed to Bermuda, then on past Venezuela
and Brazil around the Horn. It visited
the Falkland Islands, and by the third week
of October was on the coast of Chile. The
Canopus had dropped behind for repairs, and
though reinforcements were expected, they
had not yet arrived. They knew that their
force was inferior to that of Admiral von Spee.</p>

<p>One officer wrote, on the 12th of October,
“From now till the end of the month is the
critical time, as it will decide whether we shall
have to fight a superior German force from
the Pacific before we can get reinforcements
from home or the Mediterranean. We feel
that the admiralty ought to have a better force
here, but we shall fight cheerfully whatever
odds we have to face.”</p>

<p>Admiral Cradock knew well that his enemy
was superior in force. From Coronel, where
he sent off some cables, he went north on the
first of November, and about four o’clock in
the afternoon the Glasgow sighted the enemy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
The two big German armored cruisers were
leading the way, and two light cruisers were
following close. The German cruiser Leipzig
does not seem to have been in company. The
British squadron was led by the Good Hope,
with the Monmouth, Glasgow and Otranto
following in order. It was a beautiful spectacle.
The sun was setting in the wonderful
glory which one sees in the Pacific, and the
British ships, west of the German, must have
appeared to them in brilliant colors. On the
east were the snowy peaks of the Andes. Half
a gale was blowing and the two squadrons
moved south at great speed. About seven
o’clock they were about seven miles apart and
the Scharnhorst, which was leading the German
fleet, opened fire. At this time the Germans
were shaded by the inshore twilight, but
the British ships must have showed up plainly
in the afterglow. The enemy fired with great
accuracy. Shell after shell hit the Good Hope
and the Monmouth, but the bad light and inferior
guns saved the German ships from much
damage. The Good Hope was set on fire and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
at seven-fifty exploded and sank. The Monmouth
was also on fire, and turned away to
the western sea. The Glasgow had escaped
so far, but the whole German squadron bore
down upon her. She turned and fled and by
nine o’clock was out of sight of the enemy.
The Otranto, only an armed liner, had disappeared
early in the fight. On the following
day the Glasgow worked around to the south,
and joined the Canopus, and the two proceeded
to the Straits of the Magellan. The account
of this battle by the German Admiral von
Spee is of especial interest:</p>

<p>“Wind and swell were head on, and the vessels
had heavy going, especially the small
cruisers on both sides. Observation and distance
estimation were under a severe handicap
because of the seas which washed over the
bridges. The swell was so great that it obscured
the aim of the gunners at the six-inch
guns on the middle deck, who could not see
the sterns of the enemy ships at all, and the
bow but seldom. At 6.20 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, at a distance
of 13,400 yards, I turned one point toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the enemy, and at 6.34 opened fire at a distance
of 11,260 yards. The guns of both our
armored cruisers were effective, and at 6.39 already
we could note the first hit on the Good
Hope. I at once resumed a parallel course,
instead of bearing slightly toward the enemy.
The English opened their fire at this time. I
assume that the heavy sea made more trouble
for them than it did for us. Their two armored
cruisers remained covered by our fire, while
they, so far as could be determined, hit the
Scharnhorst but twice, and the Gneisenau only
four times. At 6.53, when 6,500 yards apart,
I ordered a course one point away from the
enemy. They were firing more slowly at this
time, while we were able to count numerous
hits. We could see, among other things, that
the top of the Monmouth’s forward turret had
been shot away, and that a violent fire was
burning in the turret. The Scharnhorst, it
is thought, hit the Good Hope about thirty-five
times. In spite of our altered course the
English changed theirs sufficiently so that the
distance between us shrunk to 5,300 yards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
There was reason to suspect that the enemy despaired
of using his artillery effectively, and
was maneuvering for a torpedo attack.</p>

<p>“The position of the moon which had risen
at six o’clock, was favorable to this move.
Accordingly I gradually opened up further
distances between the squadrons by another
deflection of the leading ship, at 7.45. In the
meantime it had grown dark. The range
finders on the Scharnhorst used the fire on the
Monmouth as a guide for a time, though eventually
all range finding, aiming and observations
became so inexact that fire was stopped
at 7.26. At 7.23 a column of fire from an
explosion was noticed between the stacks of
the Good Hope. The Monmouth apparently
stopped firing at 7.20. The small cruisers, including
the Nuremburg, received by wireless
at 7.30 the order to follow the enemy and to
attack his ships with torpedoes. Vision was
somewhat obscured at this time by a rain squall.
The light cruisers were not able to find the
Good Hope, but the Nuremburg encountered
the Monmouth and at 8.58 was able, by shots at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
closest range, to capsize her, without a single
shot being fired in return. Rescue work in
the heavy sea was not to be thought of, especially
as the Nuremburg immediately afterwards
believed she had sighted the smoke of
another ship and had to prepare for another
attack. The small cruisers had neither losses
nor damage in the battle. On the Gneisenau
there were two men slightly wounded. The
crews of the ships went into the fight with
enthusiasm, everyone did his duty, and played
his part in the victory.”</p>

<p>Little criticism can be made of the tactics
used by Vice-Admiral Spee. He appears to
have maneuvered so as to secure the advantage
of light, wind and sea. He also seems to have
suited himself as regards the range.</p>

<p>Admiral Cradock was much criticised for
joining battle with his little fleet against such
odds, but he followed the glorious traditions
of the English navy. He, and 1,650 officers
and men, were lost, and the news was hailed
as a great German victory. But the British
admiralty were thoroughly roused. Rear-Admiral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Sir Frederick Doveton Sturdee, chief of
the war staff, proceeded at once with a squadron
to the South Atlantic. With him were
two battle cruisers, the Invincible and the Inflexible,
three armored cruisers, the Carnovan,
the Kent and the Cornwall. His fleet was
joined by the light cruiser Bristol and the
armed liner Macedonia. The Glasgow, fresh
from her rough experience, was found in the
South Atlantic. Admiral Sturdee then laid
his plans to come in touch with the victorious
German squadron. A wireless message was
sent to the Canopus, bidding her proceed to
Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands. This
message was intercepted by the Germans, as
was intended.</p>

<p>Admiral von Spee, fearing the Japanese
fleet, was already headed for Cape Horn. He
thought that the Canopus could be easily captured
at Port Stanley, and he started at once
to that port. Admiral Sturdee’s expedition
had been kept profoundly secret. On December
7th the British squadron arrived at Port
Stanley, and spent the day coaling. The Canopus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the Glasgow and the Bristol were in the
inner harbor, while the remaining vessels lay
outside. On December 8th, Admiral von Spee
arrived from the direction of Cape Horn.
The battle that followed is thoroughly described
in the report of Vice-Admiral Sturdee
from which the following extracts have been
made:</p>

<p>“At 8 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, Tuesday, December 8th, a signal
was received from the signal station on
shore. ‘A four-funnel and two-funnel man-of-war
in sight from Sapper Hill steering
north.’ The Kent was at once ordered to
weigh anchor, and a general signal was made
to raise steam for full speed. At 8.20 the signal
service station reported another column
of smoke in sight, and at 8.47 the Canopus
reported that the first two ships were eight
miles off, and that the smoke reported at 8.20
appeared to be the smoke of two ships about
twenty miles off. At 9.20 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the two leading
ships of the enemy, the Gneisenau and
Nuremburg, with guns trained on the wireless
station, came within range of the Canopus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
which opened fire at them across the lowland
at a range of 11,000 yards. The enemy at
once hoisted their colors, and turned away. A
few minutes later the two cruisers altered
course to port, as though to close the Kent
at the entrance to the harbor. But at about
this time it seems that the Invincible and Inflexible
were seen over the land, and the enemy
at once altered course, and increased speed to
join their consorts. At 9.45 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the squadron
weighed anchor and proceeded out of the
harbor, the Carnovan leading. On passing
Cape Pembroke light, the five ships of the
enemy appeared clearly in sight to the southeast,
hull down. The visibility was at its
maximum, the sea was calm, with a bright
sun, a clear sky, and a light breeze from the
northwest. At 10.20 the signal for a general
chase was made. At this time the enemy’s
funnels and bridges showed just above the
horizon. Information was received from the
Bristol at 11.27 that three enemy ships had
appeared off Port Pleasant, probably colliers
or transports. The Bristol was therefore directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
to take the Macedonia under orders, and
destroy transports.</p>

<p>“The enemy were still maintaining their distance,
and I decided at 12.20 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> to attack,
with the two battle cruisers and the Glasgow.
At 12.47 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the signal to ‘Open fire and
engage the enemy’ was made. The Inflexible
opened fire at 12.55 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> at the right-hand
ship of the enemy, and a few minutes later
the Invincible opened fire at the same ship.
The deliberate fire became too threatening, and
when a shell fell close alongside her at 1.20
<span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> she, the Leipzig, turned away, with the
Nuremburg and Dresden, to the southwest.
These light cruisers were at once followed by
the Kent, Glasgow and Cornwall.</p>

<p>“The action finally developed into three
separate encounters. First, the action with
the armored cruisers. The fire of the battle
cruisers was directed on the Scharnhorst and
Gneisenau. The effect of this was quickly
seen, when, with the Scharnhorst leading, they
turned about seven points to port, and opened
fire. Shortly afterwards the battle cruisers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
were ordered to turn together with the Invincible
leading. The enemy then turned about
ten points to starboard, and a second chase
ensued until, at 2.45, the battle cruisers again
opened fire. This caused the enemy to turn
into line ahead to port and open fire. The
Scharnhorst caught fire forward, but not seriously,
and her fire slackened perceptibly.
The Gneisenau was badly hit by the Inflexible.</p>

<p>“At 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the Scharnhorst turned about
ten points to starboard, her fire had slackened
perceptibly, and one shell had shot away her
third funnel. Some guns were not firing, and
it would appear that the turn was dictated by
a desire to bring her starboard guns into action.
The effect of the fire on the Scharnhorst became
more and more apparent in consequence
of smoke from fires and also escaping steam.
At times a shell would cause a large hole to
appear in her side, through which could be
seen a dull, red glow of flame.</p>

<p>“At 4.04 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the Scharnhorst, whose flag
remained flying to the last, suddenly listed
heavily to port, and within a minute it became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
clear that she was a doomed ship, for the list
increased very rapidly until she lay on her
beam ends. At 4.17 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> she disappeared.
The Gneisenau passed on the far side of her
late flagship, and continued a determined, but
ineffectual, effort to fight the two battle
cruisers. At 5.08 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the forward funnel was
knocked over, and remained resting against the
second funnel. She was evidently in serious
straits, and her fire slackened very much.</p>

<p>“At 5.15 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> one of the Gneisenau’s shells
struck the Invincible. This was her last effective
effort. At 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> she turned toward
the flagship with a heavy list to starboard, and
appeared to stop, the steam pouring from her
escape pipes, and smoke from shell and fires
rising everywhere. About this time I ordered
the signal ‘Cease fire,’ but before it was hoisted,
the Gneisenau opened fire again, and continued
to fire from time to time with a single gun.
At 5.40 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the three ships closed in on the
Gneisenau, and at this time the flag flying at
her fore truck, was apparently hauled down,
but the flag at the peak continued flying. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
5.50 ‘Cease fire’ was made. At 6 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the
Gneisenau keeled over very suddenly, showing
the men gathered on her decks, and then walking
on her side as she lay for a minute on her
beam ends before sinking.</p>

<p>“The prisoners of war from the Gneisenau
report that by the time the ammunition was
expended some six hundred men had been
killed and wounded. When the ship capsized
and sank there were probably some two hundred
unwounded survivors in the water, but,
owing to the shock of the cold water, many
were drowned within sight of the boats and
ships. Every effort was made to save life as
quickly as possible, both by boats and from the
ships. Life buoys were thrown and ropes
lowered, but only a portion could be rescued.
The Invincible alone rescued a hundred and
eight men, fourteen of whom were found to be
dead after being brought on board. These
men were buried at sea the following day, with
full military honors.</p>

<p>“Second, action with the light cruisers.
About one <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> when the Scharnhorst and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Gneisenau turned to port to engage the Invincible
and the Inflexible, the enemy’s light
cruisers turned to starboard to escape. The
Dresden was leading, and the Nuremburg and
Leipzig followed on each quarter. In accordance
with my instructions, the Glasgow, Kent
and Cornwall at once went in chase of these
ships. The Glasgow drew well ahead of the
Cornwall and Kent, and at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> shots were
exchanged with the Leipzig at 12,000 yards.
The Glasgow’s object was to endeavor to outrange
the Leipzig, and thus cause her to alter
course and give the Cornwall and Kent a
chance of coming into action. At 4.17 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>
the Cornwall opened fire also on the Leipzig;
at 7.17 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the Leipzig was on fire fore and
aft, and the Cornwall and Glasgow ceased
fire. The Leipzig turned over on her port side
and disappeared at 9 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Seven officers and
eleven men were saved. At 3.36 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the
Cornwall ordered the Kent to engage the
Nuremburg, the nearest cruiser to her. At
6.35 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the Nuremburg was on fire forward,
and ceased firing. The Kent also ceased firing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
then, as the colors were still observed to
be flying on the Nuremburg, the Kent opened
fire again. Fire was finally stopped five minutes
later, on the colors being hauled down, and
every preparation was made to save life. The
Nuremburg sank at 7.27, and as she sank a
group of men were waving the German ensign
attached to a staff.</p>

<p>“Twelve men were rescued, but only seven
survived. The Kent had four killed and
twelve wounded, mostly caused by one shell.
During the time the three cruisers were engaged
with the Nuremburg and Leipzig, the
Dresden, which was beyond her consorts,
effected her escape, owing to her superior
speed. The Glasgow was the only cruiser
with sufficient speed to have had any chance of
success, however she was fully employed in
engaging the Leipzig for over an hour before
either the Cornwall or Kent could come up
and get within range. During this time the
Dresden was able to increase her distance and
get out of sight. Three, Action with the
enemy’s transports. H.M.S. Macedonia reports
that only two ships, the steamships Baden
and Santa Isabel, were present. Both ships
were sunk after removal of the crews.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Thus was annihilated the last squadron belonging
to Germany outside the North Sea.
The defeat of Cradock had been revenged.
The British losses were very small, considering
the length of the fight and the desperate efforts
of the German fleet. Only one ship of the
German squadron was able to escape, and this
on account of her great speed. The German
sailors went down with colors flying. They
died as Cradock’s men had died.</p>

<p>The naval war now entered upon a new
phase. The shores of Great Britain had for
many years been so thoroughly protected by
the British navy that few coast fortifications
had been built, except at important naval stations.
Invasion on a grand scale was plainly
impossible, so long as the British fleets held
control of the sea. With German guns across
the Channel almost within hearing it was evident
that a raiding party might easily reach
the English shore on some foggy night. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
English people were much disturbed. They
had read the accounts of the horrible brutalities
of the German troops in Belgium and eastern
France, and they imagined their feelings if a
band of such ferocious brutes were to land in
England and pillage their peaceful homes.
There was a humorous side to the way in which
the yeomanry and territorials entrenched
themselves along the eastern coast line, but the
Germans, angry at the failure of their fleets,
determined to disturb the British peace by
raids, slight as the military advantage of such
raids might be.</p>

<p>On November 2d a fleet of German warships
sailed from the Elbe. They were three battle
cruisers, the Seydlitz, the Moltke, and the Von
Der Tann; two armored cruisers, the Blücher
and the York, and three light cruisers, the
Kolberg, the Graudenz, and the Strasburg.
They were mainly fast vessels and the battle
cruisers carried eleven-inch guns. Early in
the morning they ran through the nets of a
British fishing fleet. Later an old coast police
boat, the Halcyon, was shot at a few times.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
About eight o’clock they were opposite Yarmouth,
and proceeded to bombard that naval
station from a distance of about ten miles.
Their range was poor and their shells did no
damage. They then turned swiftly for home,
but on the road back the York struck a mine,
and was sunk.</p>

</figure>

<p>On the 16th of December they came again,
full of revenge because of the destruction of
von Spee and his squadron. Early in the
morning early risers in Scarborough saw in the
north four strange ships. Scarborough was
absolutely without defense. It had once been
an artillery depot but in recent years had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
a cavalry station, and some few troops of this
service were quartered there. Otherwise it
was an open seaside resort. The German
ships poured shells into the defenseless town,
aiming at every large object they could see,
the Grand Hotel, the gas works, the water
works and the wireless station. Churches,
public buildings, and hospitals were hit, as well
as private houses. Over five hundred shells
were fired. Then the ships turned around and
moved away. The streets were crowded with
puzzled and scared inhabitants, many of whom,
as is customary in watering places, were
women, children and invalids.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_134">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="GERMANY CARRIES THE WAR TO EAST COAST TOWNS OF ENGLAND">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">GERMANY CARRIES THE WAR TO EAST COAST TOWNS OF ENGLAND</p>

<p>By raids with light cruisers on the coast towns, and Zeppelins and airplanes
further inland, Germany sought to frighten the British populace. At Hartlepool,
where this scene was enacted, several civilians, some of them women and children,
were killed by bursting shells of the raiders.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At nine o’clock Whitby, a coast town near
Scarborough, saw two great ships steaming up
from the south. Ten minutes later the ships
were firing. The old Abbey of Hilda and
Cedman was struck, but on the whole little
damage was done. Another division of the invaders
visited the Hartlepools. There there
was a small fort, with a battery of old-fashioned
guns, and off the shore was a small British
flotilla, a gunboat and two destroyers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>The three battle cruisers among the German
raiders opened fire. The little British fleet
did what they could but were quickly driven
off. The German ships then approached the
shore and fired on the English battery, the first
fight with a foreign foe in England since 1690.
The British battery consisted of some territorials
who stood without wavering to their guns
and kept up for half an hour a furious cannonading.
A great deal of damage was done;
churches, hospitals, workhouses and schools
were all hit. The total deathroll was 119, and
the wounded over 300. Six hundred houses
were damaged or destroyed, but there was a
great deal of heroism, not only among the
territorials, but among the inhabitants of the
town, and when the last shots were fired all
turned to the work of relief.</p>

<p>Somewhere between nine and ten o’clock the
bold German fleet started for home. The
British Grand Fleet had been notified of the
raid and two battle cruiser squadrons were
hurrying to intercept them. But the weather
had thickened and the waters of the North Sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
were covered with fog belts stretching for hundreds
of miles. And so the raiders returned
safe to receive their Iron Crosses. The German
aim in such raids was probably to create
a panic, and so interfere with the English
military plans. If the English had not looked
at the matter with common sense they might
easily have been tempted to spend millions of
pounds on seaboard fortifications, and keep
millions of men at home who were more necessary
in the armies in France. But the English
people kept their heads.</p>

<p>Germany, perceiving the indignation of the
world at these bombardments of defenseless
watering places, endeavored to appease criticism
by describing them as fortified towns.
But the well-known excellence of the German
system of espionage makes it plain that they
knew the true condition of affairs. These
towns were not selected as fortified towns, but
because they were not, and destruction in unfortified
towns it was thought would have a
greater effect than in a fortified town where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
it would be regarded as among the natural
risks of war.</p>

<p>During the rest of the year of 1914 no further
sea-fight took place in the North Sea nor
was there any serious loss to the navy from
torpedo or submarine. But on the first of
January, 1915, the British ship Formidable,
15,000 tons, was struck by two torpedoes and
sunk. The previous day she had left Sheerness
with eight vessels of the Channel fleet and
with no protection from destroyers. The
night was a bright moonlight and for such vessels
to be moving in line on such a night without
destroyers shows gross carelessness. Out
of a crew of 800 men only 201 were saved,
and the rescue of this part of the crew was
due to the seamanship of Captain Pillar of
the trawler Providence, who managed to take
most of those rescued on board his vessel.</p>

<p>On January 24th the German battle cruiser
squadron under Rear-Admiral Hipper set sail
from Wilhelmshaven. What his object was is
not known. He had enlarged the mine field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
north of Helgoland and north of the mine
field had stationed a submarine flotilla. It is
likely that he was planning to induce the British
fleet to follow him into the mine field, or
within reach of his submarines. That same
morning the British battle cruiser squadron
under Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty put to
sea.</p>

<p>According to the official report of the
English Admiral he was in command of the
following vessels: battle cruisers, the Lion,
Princess Royal, the Tiger, the New Zealand,
and the Indomitable; light cruisers, the Southampton,
the Nottingham, the Birmingham, the
Lowestoft, the Arethusa, the Aurora and the
Undaunted, with destroyer flotillas under
Commodore Tyrwhitt. The German Admiral
had with him the Seydlitz, the Moltke, the
Derfflinger, the Blücher, six light cruisers and
a destroyer flotilla. The English Admiral apparently
had some hint of the plans of the German
squadron. The night of the 23d had been
foggy; in the morning, however, the wind came
from the northeast and cleared off the mists.
An abridgment of the official report gives a
good account of the battle, sometimes called
the battle of Dogger Bank:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“At 7.25 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the flash of guns was observed
south-southeast; shortly afterwards the report
reached me from the Aurora that she was engaged
with enemy ships. I immediately altered
course to south-southeast, increased
speed, and ordered the light cruisers and flotillas
to get in touch and report movements of
enemy. This order was acted upon with great
promptitude, indeed my wishes had already
been forestalled by the respective senior officers,
and reports almost immediately followed
from the Southampton, Arethusa, and Aurora
as to the position and composition of the
enemy. The enemy had altered their course
to southeast; from now onward the light
cruisers maintained touch with the enemy and
kept me fully informed as to their movements.
The battle cruisers worked up to full speed,
steering to the southward; the wind at the time
was northeast, light, with extreme visibility.</p>

<p>“At 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the enemy were sighted on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
port bow, steaming fast, steering approximately
southeast, distance fourteen miles.
Owing to the prompt reports received we had
attained our position on the quarter of the enemy,
and altered course to run parallel to them.
We then settled down to a long stern chase,
gradually increasing our speed until we
reached 28.5 knots.</p>

<p>“Great credit is due to the engineer staffs of
the New Zealand and Indomitable. These
ships greatly exceeded their speed. At 8.52
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, as we had closed within 20,000 yards of
the rear ship, the battle cruisers maneuvered so
that guns would bear and the Lion fired a
single shot which fell short. The enemy at this
time were in single line ahead, with light
cruisers ahead and a large number of destroyers
on their starboard beam. Single
shots were fired at intervals to test the range
and at 9.09 the Lion made her first hit on the
Blücher, the rear ship of the German line. At
9.20 the Tiger opened fire on the Blücher, and
the Lion shifted to the third in the line, this
ship being hit by several salvos. The enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
returned our fire at 9.14 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, the Princess
Royal, on coming into range, opened fire on the
Blücher. The New Zealand was also within
range of the Blücher which had dropped somewhat
astern, and opened fire on her. The
Princess Royal then shifted to the third ship in
the line (Derfflinger) inflicting considerable
damage on her. Our flotilla cruisers and destroyers
had gradually dropped from a position,
broad on our beam, to our port quarter,
so as not to foul our range with their smoke.
But the enemy’s destroyers threatening attack,
the Meteor and M division passed ahead of us.</p>

<p>“About 9.45 the situation was about as follows:
The Blücher, the fourth in her line,
showed signs of having suffered severely from
gun fire, their leading ship and number three
were also on fire. The enemy’s destroyers
emitted vast columns of smoke to screen their
battle cruisers, and under cover of this the latter
now appeared to have altered course to the
northward to increase their distance. The battle
cruisers therefore were ordered to form a
line of bearing north-northwest, and proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
at the utmost speed. Their destroyers then
showed evident signs of an attempt to attack.
The Lion and the Tiger opened fire upon them,
and caused them to retire and resume their
original course.</p>

<p>“At 10.48 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the Blücher, which had
dropped considerably astern of the enemy’s
line, hauled out to port, steering north with a
heavy list, on fire, and apparently in a defeated
condition. I consequently ordered the Indomitable
to attack the enemy breaking northward.
At 10.54 submarines were reported on
the starboard bow, and I personally observed
the wash of a periscope. I immediately turned
to port. At 10.03 an injury to the Lion being
reported as being incapable of immediate repair,
I directed the Lion to shape course northwest.</p>

<p class="caption">THE SINKING OF THE GERMAN CRUISER “BLÜCHER”</p>

<p>This dramatic photograph from the great North Sea Battle in 1915 shows the stricken ship just as she turned turtle and was about
to sink. Officers and men can be seen swarming like ants on the upper side of the hull. Others, who either fell or preferred to take
their chance in the sea, are shown swimming away from the wreck.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“At 11.20 I called the Attack alongside,
shifting my flag to her, and proceeded at utmost
speed to rejoin the squadron. I met
them at noon, retiring north-northwest. I
boarded and hoisted my flag on the Princess
Royal, when Captain Brock acquainted me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
with what had occurred since the Lion fell out
of line, namely, that the Blücher had been sunk
and that the enemy battle cruisers had continued
their course to the eastward in a considerably
damaged condition. He also informed
me that a Zeppelin and a seaplane had endeavored
to drop bombs on the vessels which
went to the rescue of the survivors of the
Blücher.”</p>

<p>It appears from this report that as soon as
the Germans sighted the British fleet they
promptly turned around and fled to the southeast.
This flight, before they could have known
the full British strength, suggests that the
German Admiral was hoping to lure the British
vessels into the Helgoland trap. The
British gunnery was remarkably good, shot
after shot taking effect at a distance of ten
miles, and that too when moving at over thirty
miles an hour. Over 120 of the crew of the
Blücher were rescued and more would have
been rescued if it had not been for the attack
upon the rescue parties by the German aircraft.
The injury to the Lion was very unfortunate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Admiral Beatty handed over charge of the battle
cruisers to Rear-Admiral Moore, and when
he was able to overtake the squadron he found
that under Admiral Moore’s orders the British
fleet were retiring. The British squadron at
the moment of turning was seventy miles from
Helgoland, and in no danger from its mine
fields. What might have been a crushing victory
became therefore only a partial one: the
Germans lost the Blücher; the Derfflinger and
the Seydlitz were badly injured, but it seems
that with a little more persistence the whole
German squadron might have been destroyed.</p>

<p>The result was a serious blow to Germany.
This engagement was the first between modern
big-gun ships. Particular interest is also attached
to it because each squadron was accompanied
by scouting and screening light cruisers
and destroyers. It was fear of submarines and
mines, moreover, that influenced the British
to break off the engagement. A Zeppelin airship
and a seaplane also took part, and perhaps
assisted in the fire control of the Germans.
The conditions surrounding this battle were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
ideal for illustrating the functions of battle
cruisers. The German warship raid on the
British coast of the previous month was still
fresh in mind, and when this situation off the
Dogger Bank arose the timely interposing of
Admiral Beatty’s superior force, the fast chase,
the long-range fighting, the loss of the Blücher
and the hasty retreat of the enemy, were all
particularly pleasing to the British people.
As a result the battle cruiser type of ship attained
great popularity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="smcap">German Plots and Propaganda in
America</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE pages of Germany’s militaristic history
are black with many shameful deeds
and plots. Those pages upon which are written
the intrigues against the peace of America
and against the lives and properties of American
citizens during the period between the
declaration of war in 1914 and the armistice
ending the war, while not so bloody as those
relating to the atrocities in Belgium and
Northern France are still revolting to civilized
mankind.</p>

<p>Germany not only paid for the murder of
passengers on ships where its infernal machines
were placed, not only conspired for the
destruction of munition plants and factories
of many kinds, not only sought to embroil the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
United States, then neutral, in a war with
Mexico and Japan, but it committed also the
crime of murderous hypocrisy by conspiring
to do these wrongs under the cloak of friendship
for this country.</p>

<p>It was in December of 1915 that the German
Government sent to the United States
for general publication in American newspapers
this statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The German Government has naturally never knowingly
accepted the support of any person, group of persons,
society or organization seeking to promote the
cause of Germany in the United States by illegal acts,
by counsel of violence, by contravention of law, or by
any means whatever that could offend the American
people in the pride of their own authority.</p>
</div>

<p>The answer to this imperial lie came from
the President of the United States, when, in
his address to Congress, April 2, 1917, urging
a declaration of war on Germany, he characterized
the German spy system and its
frightful fruits in the following language:</p>

<p>“One of the things that has served to convince
us that the Prussian autocracy was not
and could never be our friend is that from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
very outset of the present war it has filled our
unsuspecting communities, and even our offices
of government, with spies, and set criminal
intrigues everywhere afoot against our
national unity of counsel, our peace within and
without, our industries and our commerce.
Indeed it is now evident that its spies were
here even before the war began; and it is unhappily
not a matter of conjecture, but a fact
proved in our courts of justice, that the intrigues
which have more than once come perilously
near to disturbing the peace and dislocating
the industries of the country have
been carried on at the instigation, with the
support, and even under the personal direction
of official agents of the Imperial Government
accredited to the Government of the
United States.”</p>

<p>The women of the world took up quickly almost every masculine task in industry to release their menfolk for the firing line. They
were especially valuable in the munitions factories of England, as shown above. The women in the foreground are testing shell cases
for size, while those in the background work the lathes.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Austria co-operated with Germany in a
feeble way in these plots and propaganda, but
the master plotter was Count Johann von
Bernstorff, Germany’s Ambassador. The
Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, Constantin
Theodor Dumba, Captain Franz von Papen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Captain Karl Boy-Ed, Dr. Heinrich F. Albert,
and Wolf von Igel, all of whom were
attached to the German embassy, were associates
in the intrigues. Franz von Rintelen
operated independently and received his funds
and instructions directly from Berlin.</p>

<p>One of the earliest methods of creating disorder
in American munition plants and other
industrial establishments engaged in war
work was through labor disturbances. With
that end in view a general German employment
bureau was established in August, 1915,
in New York City. It had branches in Philadelphia,
Bridgeport, Pittsburgh, Cleveland,
Chicago and Cincinnati. These cities at that
time were the centers of industries engaged in
furnishing munitions and war supplies to the
Entente allies. Concerning this enterprise
Ambassador Dumba writing to Baron Burian,
Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A private German employment office has been established
which provides employment for persons who have
voluntarily given up their places, and it is already working
well. We shall also join in and the widest support
is assured us.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>The duties of men sent from the German
employment offices into munition plants may
be gathered from the following frank circular
issued on November 2, 1914, by the German
General Headquarters and reprinted in the
<i>Freie Zeitung</i>, of Berne.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Headquarters to the Military Representative<br>
on the Russian and French Fronts, as<br>
Well as in Italy and Norway</span></p>

<p>In all branch establishments of German banking houses
in Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, China and the United
States, special military accounts have been opened for
special war necessities. Main headquarters authorizes
you to use these credits to an unlimited extent for the
purpose of destroying factories, workshops, camps, and
the most important centers of military and civil supply
belonging to the enemy. In addition to the incitement of
labor troubles, measures must be taken for the damaging
of engines and machinery plants, the destruction of
vessels carrying war material to enemy countries, the
burning of stocks of raw materials and finished goods,
and the depriving of large industrial centers of electric
power, fuel and food. Special agents, who will be
placed at your disposal, will supply you with the necessary
means for effecting explosions and fires, as well
as with a list of people in the country under your supervision
who are willing to undertake the task of destruction.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Dr. E. Fischer.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Shortly after the establishment of the German
employment bureau, Ambassador Dumba
sent the following communication to the
Austrian Foreign Office:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is my impression that we can disorganize and hold
up for months, if not entirely prevent, the manufacture
of munitions in Bethlehem and the Middle West, which,
in the opinion of the German military attaché, is of importance
and amply outweighs the comparatively small
expenditure of money involved.</p>
</div>

<p>Concerning the operations of the arson and
murder squad organized by von Bernstorff,
Dumba and their associates, it is only necessary
to turn to the records of the criminal
courts of the United States and Canada.
Take for example the case against Albert
Kaltschmidt, living in Detroit, Michigan.
The United States grand jury sitting in Detroit
indicted Kaltschmidt and his fellow conspirators
upon the following counts:</p>

<p>“To blow up the factory of the Peabody’s
Company, Limited, at Walkerville, Ontario,
... engaged in manufacturing uniforms,
clothing and military supplies....</p>

<p>“To blow up the building known as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Windsor Armories of the City of Windsor....</p>

<p>“To blow up and destroy other plants and
buildings in said Dominion of Canada, which
were used for the manufacture of munitions
of war, clothing and uniforms.</p>

<p>“To blow up and destroy the great railroad
bridges of the Canadian Pacific Railroad at
Nipigon....</p>

<p>“To employ and send into said Dominion
of Canada spies to obtain military information.”</p>

<p>Besides the acts enumerated in the indictment
it was proved upon trial that Kaltschmidt
and his gang planned to blow up the
Detroit Screw Works where shrapnel was being
manufactured, and to destroy the St. Clair
tunnel, connecting Canada with the United
States. Both of these plans failed. Associated
with Kaltschmidt in these plots were
Captain von Papen, Baron Kurt von Reiswitz,
German consul-general in Chicago;
Charles F. Respa, Richard Herman, and
William M. Jarasch, the latter two German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
reservists. Testifying in the case Jarasch, a
bartender, said: “Jacobsen (an aide) told
me that munition factories in Canada were to
be blown up. Before I left for Detroit,
Jacobsen and I went to the consulate. We
saw the consul and he shook hands with me
and wished me success.”</p>

<p>Charles F. Respa in his testimony made the
following revelations in response to questions
by the government’s representatives:</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How long had you been employed before
he (Kaltschmidt) told you that he
wanted you to blow up some of these factories?
<i>A.</i> About three weeks.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did Kaltschmidt at the time speak of
any particular place that he wanted you to
blow up? <i>A.</i> The particular place was the
Armory.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did he mention the Peabody Building
at that time? <i>A.</i> Not particularly—he was
more after the bridges and the armories and
wanted those places blown up that made ammunition
and military clothing.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> The explosion at the armories was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
timed so that it would occur when the soldiers
were asleep there? <i>A.</i> Yes—he did not mention
that he wanted to kill soldiers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did he say that if the dynamite in the
suitcase exploded it would kill the soldiers?
<i>A.</i> I do not remember that he said so, but he
must have known it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you take both grips? <i>A.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Where did you set the first grip? <i>A.</i>
By the Peabody plant (blown up on June 20,
1915).</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Where did you put the other suitcase?
<i>A.</i> Then I walked down the Walkerville road
to the Armories at Windsor, and carried the
suitcase.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When you got to the Armories did you
know where to place it? <i>A.</i> I had my instructions.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> From Kaltschmidt? <i>A.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you place this suitcase containing
the dynamite bomb at the armory in a proper
place to explode and do any damage? <i>A.</i>
Yes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Was it properly connected so that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
cap would explode and strike the dynamite?
<i>A.</i> I fixed it so that it would not.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you deliberately fix this bomb that
you took to the Armories so that it would not
explode? <i>A.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why did you do that? <i>A.</i> I knew that
the suitcase contained thirty sticks of dynamite
and if exploded would blow up the Armories
and all the ammunition and kill every
man in it.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection
that Kaltschmidt was sentenced to four years
in the federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas,
and to pay a fine of $20,000. Horn’s sentence
was eighteen months in the Atlanta penitentiary
and a fine of $1,000.</p>

<p>Attempts were also made to close by explosions
the tunnels through which the Canadian
Pacific Railroad passes under the Selkirk
Mountains in British Columbia. The
German General Staff in this instance operated
through Franz Bopp, the German consul-general
in San Francisco, and Lieutenant von
Brincken. J. H. van Koolbergen was hired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
to do this work. Concerning the negotiations,
van Koolbergen made this statement:</p>

<p>“Not knowing what he wanted I went to see
him. He was very pleasant and told me that
he was an officer in the German army and at
present working in the secret service of the
German Empire under Mr. Franz Bopp, the
Imperial German consul.</p>

<p>“I went to the consulate and met Franz
Bopp and then saw von Brincken in another
room. He asked me if I would do something
for him in Canada and I answered him, ‘Sure,
I will do something, even blow up bridges, if
there is money in it.’ And he said, ‘You are
the man; if that is so, you can make good
money.’</p>

<p>“Von Brincken told me that they were willing
to send me up to Canada to blow up one
of the bridges on the Canadian Pacific Railroad
or one of the tunnels. I asked him what
was in it and he said he would talk it over with
the German consul, Bopp.</p>

<p>“I had accepted von Brincken’s proposition
to go to Canada and he offered me $500 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
defray my expenses. On different occasions,
in his room, von Brincken showed me maps
and information about Canada, and pointed
out to me where he wanted the act to be done.
This was to be between Revelstoke and Vancouver
on the Canadian Pacific Railroad, and
I was to get $3,000 in case of a successful
blowing up of a military bridge or tunnel.”</p>

<p>Van Koolbergen only made a pretended effort
to blow up the tunnel. He did furnish
the evidence, however, which served to send
Bopp and his associates to the penitentiary.</p>

<p>Even more sensational was the plot against
the international bridge upon which the Grand
Trunk Railway crosses the border between the
United States and Canada at Vanceboro, Me.</p>

<p>Werner Horn was a German reserve lieutenant.
Von Papen delivered to him a flat
order to blow up the bridge and he gave him
$700 for the purpose of perpetrating the outrage.
Horn was partially successful. At his
trial in Boston in June, 1917, he made the following
confession:</p>

<p>“I admit and state that the facts set forth in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the indictments as to the conveyance of explosives
on certain passenger trains from New
York to Boston and from Boston to Vanceboro,
in the State of Maine, are true. I did,
as therein alleged, receive an explosive and
conveyed the same from the city of New York
to Boston, thence by common carrier from
Boston to Vanceboro, Maine. On or about
the night of February 1, 1915, I took said explosive
in a suitcase in which I was conveying
it and carried the same across the bridge at
Vanceboro to the Canadian side, and there,
about 1.10 in the morning of February 2, 1915,
I caused said explosive to be exploded near or
against the abutments of the bridge on the
Canadian side, with intent to destroy the abutment
and cripple the bridge so that the same
could not be used for the passage of trains.”</p>

<p>Bribery of congressmen was intended by
Franz von Rintelen, operating directly in
touch with the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
Count von Bernstorff, Germany’s Ambassador
at Washington, sent the following
telegram to Berlin in connection with his plan:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>I request authority to pay out up to $50,000 in order,
as on former occasions, to influence Congress through
the organization you know of, which can perhaps prevent
war. I am beginning in the meantime to act accordingly.
In the above circumstances, a public official German
declaration in favor of Ireland is highly desirable,
in order to gain the support of the Irish influence here.</p>
</div>

<p>That it was Rintelen’s purpose to use large
sums of money for the purpose of bribing congressmen
was stated positively by George
Plochman, treasurer of the Transatlantic
Trust Company, where Rintelen kept his deposits.</p>

<p>Rintelen was the main figure on this side of
the water in the fantastic plot to have Mexico
and Japan declare war upon the United States.
During the trial of Rintelen in New York
City in May, 1917, it was testified “that he
came to the United States in order to embroil
it with Mexico and Japan if necessary; that he
was doing all he could and was going to do all
he could to embroil this country with Mexico;
that he believed that if the United States had
a war with Mexico it would stop the shipment
of ammunition to Europe; that he believed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
would be only a matter of time until we were
involved with Japan.”</p>

<p>Rintelen also said that “General Huerta
was going to return to Mexico and start a revolution
there which would cause the United
States to intervene and so make it impossible
to ship munitions to Europe. Intervention,”
he said, “was one of his trump cards.”</p>

<p>Mexico was the happy hunting-ground for
pro-German plotters, and the German Ambassador
in Mexico, Heinrich von Eckhardt,
was the leader in all the intrigues. The culmination
of Germany’s effort against America
on this continent came on January 19, 1917,
when Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, head of the
German Foreign Office, sent the following
cable to Ambassador von Eckhardt:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the first of February we intend to begin submarine
warfare unrestricted. In spite of this, it is our intention
to endeavor to keep neutral the United States of
America.</p>

<p>If this attempt is not successful, we propose an alliance
on the following basis with Mexico: That we
shall make war together and together make peace. We
shall give general financial support, and it is understood
that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Mexico, Texas and Arizona. The details are left to you
for settlement. You are instructed to inform the President
of Mexico of the above in the greatest confidence as
soon as it is certain that there will be an outbreak of war
with the United States, and suggest that the President
of Mexico, on his own initiative, should communicate with
Japan suggesting adherence at once to this plan; at the
same time, offer to mediate between Germany and
Japan.</p>

<p>Please call to the attention of the President of Mexico
that the employment of ruthless submarine warfare now
promises to compel England to make peace in a few
months.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Zimmerman.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This was almost three months before the
United States entered the war. As an example
of German blindness and diplomatic
folly it stands unrivaled in the annals of the
German Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Plots against shipping were the deadliest
in which the German conspirators engaged.
Death and destruction followed in their wake.
In direct connection of von Bernstorff and his
tools with these outrages the following testimony
by an American secret service man employed
by Wolf von Igel is interesting. It
refers to an appointment with Captain von<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Kleist, superintendent of Scheele’s bomb
factory in Hoboken, N. J.</p>

<p>“We sat down and we spoke for about three
hours. I asked him the different things that
he did, and said if he wanted an interview with
Mr. von Igel, my boss, he would have to tell
everything. So he told me that von Papen
gave Dr. Scheele, the partner of von Kleist in
this factory, a check for $10,000 to start this
bomb factory. He told me that he, Mr. von
Kleist, and Dr. Scheele and a man by the name
of Becker on the Friedrich der Grosse were
making the bombs, and that Captain Wolpert,
Captain Bode and Captain Steinberg, had
charge of putting these bombs on the ships;
they put these bombs in cases and shipped them
as merchandise on these steamers, and they
would go away on the trip and the bombs
would go off after the ship was out four or five
days, causing a fire and causing the cargo to
go up in flames. He also told me that they
have made quite a number of these bombs;
that thirty of them were given to a party by
the name of O’Leary, and that he took them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
down to New Orleans where he had charge of
putting them on ships down there, this fellow
O’Leary.”</p>

<p>About four hundred bombs were made under
von Igel’s direction; explosions and fires
were caused by them on thirty-three ships sailing
from New York harbor alone.</p>

<p>Four of the bombs were found at Marseilles
on a vessel which sailed from Brooklyn in
May, 1915. The evidence collected in the case
led to the indictment of the following men for
feloniously transporting on the steamship Kirk
Oswald a bomb or bombs filled with chemicals
designed to cause incendiary fires: Rintelen,
Wolpert, Bode, Schmidt, Becker, Garbade,
Praedel, Paradies, von Kleist, Schimmel,
Scheele, Steinberg and others. The last three
named fled from justice, Scheele being supplied
with $1,000 for that purpose by Wolf von
Igel. He eluded the Federal authorities until
April, 1918, when he was found hiding in Cuba
under the protection of German secret service
agents. All the others except Schmidt were
found guilty and sentenced, on February 5,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
1918, to imprisonment for eighteen months and
payment of a fine of $2,000 each. It was
proved during the trial that Rintelen had hired
Schimmel, a German lawyer, to see that bombs
were placed on ships.</p>

<p>Schmidt, von Kleist, Becker, Garbade,
Praedel and Paradies had already been tried
for conspiracy to make bombs for concealment
on ocean-going vessels, with the purpose of
setting the same on fire. All were found
guilty, and on April 6, 1917, von Kleist and
Schmidt were sentenced to two years’ imprisonment
and a fine of $500 each.</p>

<p>Robert Fay, a former officer in the German
army, who came to the United States in April,
1915, endeavored to prevent the traffic in munitions
by sinking the laden ships at sea. In
recounting the circumstances of his arrival
here to the chief of the United States secret
service, Fay said:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe45" id="i_164">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p><small><i>Photos from International Film Service.</i></small></p>

<p class="caption">THE GERMAN CHANCELLORS</p>

<p>On the right is Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg who is held responsible in large measure for bringing on the war. On the left is
Prince Maximilian of Baden, the Kaiser’s camouflage chancellor who was appointed in a vain attempt to fool the American people into
thinking that a democratic government had been set up in Germany.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“... I had in the neighborhood of $4,000....
This money came from a man who sent
me over ... (named) Jonnersen. The understanding
was that it might be worth while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
to stop the shipment of artillery munitions
from this country.... I imagined Jonnersen
to be in the (German) secret service.”</p>

<p>After stating that he saw von Papen and
Boy-Ed, and that neither would have anything
to do with him, apparently because they were
suspicious of his identity and feared a trap,
Fay continued:</p>

<p>“I did not want to return (to Germany)
without having carried out my intention, that
is, the destruction of ships carrying munitions.
I proceeded with my experiments and tried to
get hold of as much explosive matter as in any
way possible....”</p>

<p>Fay and two confederates were arrested in
a lonely spot near Grantwood, New Jersey,
while testing an explosive. During his examination
at police headquarters in Weehawken
immediately after the arrest he was questioned
as follows:</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> That large machine you have downstairs,
what is that?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That is a patent of mine. It is a new
way of getting a time fuse....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span><i>Q.</i> Did you know where Scholz (Fay’s
brother-in-law) had this machine made?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In different machine shops....</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What material is it you wanted (from
Daeche, an accomplice)?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Trinitrotoluol (T. N. T.)....</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How much did the machinery cost?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Roughly speaking, $150 or $200....</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What would be the cost of making one
and filling it with explosives?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> About $250 each.... If they had
given me money enough I should simply have
been able to block the shipping entirely.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you mean you could have destroyed
every ship that left the harbor by means of
those bombs?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I would have been able to stop so many
that the authorities would not have dared (to
send out any ships).</p>

<p>It was proved during Fay’s trial that his
bomb was a practical device, and that its forty
pounds of explosive would sink any ship to
which it was attached.</p>

<p>Fay and his accomplices, Scholz and Daeche,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
were convicted of conspiracy to attach explosive
bombs to the rudders of vessels, with
the intention of wrecking the same when at sea,
and were sentenced, on May 9, 1916, to terms
of eight, four and two years respectively, in
the federal penitentiary at Atlanta. Dr. Herbert
Kienzle and Max Breitung, who assisted
Fay in procuring explosives, were indicted on
the same charge. Both were interned.</p>

<p>Another plan for disabling ships was suggested
by a man who remained for some time
unknown. He called one day at the German
Military Information Bureau, maintained at
60 Wall Street by Captain von Papen, of the
German embassy, and there gave the following
outline of his plan:</p>

<p>“I intend to cause serious damage to vessels
of the Allies leaving ports of the United
States by placing bombs, which I am making
myself, on board. These bombs resemble ordinary
lumps of coal and I am planning to
have them concealed in the coal to be laden on
steamers of the Allies. I have already discussed
this plan with ... at ... and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
thinks favorably of my idea. I have been
engaged on similar work in ... after the outbreak
of the war, together with Mr. von ...”</p>

<p>The German secret service report from
which the above excerpt is taken states that the
maker of the bomb was paid by check No. 146
for $150 drawn on the Riggs National Bank
of Washington. A photographic copy of this
check shows that it was payable to Paul Koenig,
of the Hamburg-American Line and was
signed by Captain von Papen. On the counterfoil
is written this memorandum, “For F.
J. Busse.”</p>

<p>Busse confessed later that he had discussed
with Captain von Papen at the German
Club in New York City the plan of damaging
the boilers of munition ships with bombs
which resembled lumps of coal.</p>

<p>Free access to Allied ships laden with supplies
for Vladivostok would have been invaluable
to the conspirators, and in order to obtain
it Charles C. Crowley, a detective employed by
Consul-General Bopp, resorted to the extraordinary
scheme revealed in the following letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
to Madam Bakhmeteff, wife of the Russian
Ambassador to the United States:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. J. Bakhmeteff</span>, <i>care Imperial Russian Embassy,<br>
&#160; &#160; Newport, R. I.</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:—By direction of the Imperial Russian
Consul-General of San Francisco, I beg to submit the
following on behalf of several fruit-growers of the State
of California. As it is the wish of certain growers to
contribute several tons of dried fruit to the Russian
Red Cross they desire to have arrangements made to
facilitate the transportation of this fruit from Tacoma,
Washington, to Vladivostok, and as we are advised that
steamships are regularly plying between Tacoma and
Vladivostok upon which government supplies are
shipped we would like to have arrangements made that
these fruits as they might arrive would be regularly
consigned to these steamers and forwarded. It would
be necessary, therefore, that an understanding be had
with the agents of these steamship lines at Tacoma that
immediate shipments be made via whatever steamers
might be sailing.</p>

<p>It is the desire of the donors that there be no delay
in the shipments as delays would lessen the benefits intended
to those for whom the fruit was provided....</p>

</div>

<p>The statements of Louis J. Smith and van
Koolbergen, combined with a mass of other
evidence consisting in part of letters and telegrams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
caused the grand jury to indict Consul-General
Bopp, his staff and his hired agents,
for conspiracy to undertake a military enterprise
against Canada. Among the purposes
of this enterprise specified in the indictment
was the following:</p>

<p>“To blow up and destroy with their cargoes
and crews any and all vessels belonging to
Great Britain, France, Japan or Russia found
within the limits of Canada, which were laden
with horses, munitions of war, or articles of
commerce in course of transportation to the
above countries....”</p>

<p>The following descriptions have been made
by the United States Government of the tools
of von Bernstorff in German plots:</p>

<p>Paul Koenig, the head of the Hamburg-American
secret service, who was active in passport
frauds, who induced Gustave Stahl to
perjure himself and declare the Lusitania
armed, and who plotted the destruction of the
Welland Canal. In his work as a spy he
passed under thirteen aliases in this country
and Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Captains Boy-Ed, von Papen, von Rintelen,
Tauscher, and von Igel were all directly connected
with the German Government itself.
There is now in the possession of the United
States Government a check made out to Koenig
and signed by von Papen, identified by
number in a secret report of the German
Bureau of Investigation as being used to procure
$150 for the payment of a bomb-maker,
who was to plant explosives disguised as coal
in the bunkers of the merchant vessels clearing
from the port of New York. Boy-Ed, Dr.
Bunz, the German ex-minister to Mexico, the
German consul at San Francisco, and officials
of the Hamburg-American and North German
Lloyd steamship lines evaded customs
regulations and coaled and victualed German
raiders at sea. Von Papen and von Igel supervised
the making of the incendiary bombs
on the Friedrich der Grosse, then in New
York Harbor, and stowed them away on outgoing
ships. Von Rintelen financed Labor’s
National Peace Council, which tried to corrupt
legislators and labor leaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Among the other tools of the German plotters
were David Lamar and Henry Martin,
who, in the pay of Captain von Rintelen, organized
and managed the so-called Labor’s
National Peace Council, which sought to bring
about strikes, an embargo on munitions, and a
boycott of the banks which subscribed to the
Anglo-French loan. A check for $5,000 to
J. F. J. Archibald for propaganda work, and
a receipt from Edwin Emerson, the war correspondent,
for $1,000 traveling expenses were
among the documents found in Wolf von Igel’s
possession.</p>

<p class="caption">KAISER WILLIAM II OF GERMANY</p>

<p>Posterity will regard him as more responsible than any other human being for
the sacrifice of millions of lives in the great war, as a ruler who might have been
beneficent and wise, but attempted to destroy the liberties of mankind and to raise
on their ruins an odious despotism. To forgive him and to forget his terrible transgressions
would be to condone them.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Others who bore English names were persuaded
to take leading places in similar organizations
which concealed their origin and real
purpose. The American Embargo Conference
arose out of the ashes of Labor’s Peace
Council, and its president was American,
though the funds were not. Others tampered
with were journalists who lent themselves to
the German propaganda and who went so far
as to serve as couriers between the Teutonic
embassies in Washington and the governments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
in Berlin and Vienna. A check of $5,000
was discovered which Count von Bernstorff
had sent to Marcus Braun, editor of <i>Fair Play</i>.
And a letter was discovered which George Sylvester
Vierick, editor of the <i>Fatherland</i>, sent
to Privy Councilor Albert, the German agent,
arranging for a monthly subsidy of $1,750, to
be delivered to him through the hands of intermediaries—women
whose names he abbreviates
“to prevent any possible inquiry.” There is a
record of $3,000 paid through the German embassy
to finance the lecture tour of Miss Ray
Beveridge, an American artist, who was further
to be supplied with German war pictures.</p>

<p>The German propagandists also directed
their efforts to poisoning the minds of the people
through the circulation of lies concerning
affairs in France and at home. Here are some
of the rumors circulated throughout the country
that were nailed as falsehoods:</p>

<p>It was said that the national registration of
women by the Food Administration was to find
out how much money each had in the bank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
how much of this was owed, and everything
about each registrant’s personal affairs.</p>

<p>That the millions collected from the public
for the Red Cross went into the pockets of
thieves, and that the soldiers and sailors got
none of it, nor any of its benefits.</p>

<p>That base hospital units had been annihilated
while en route overseas.</p>

<p>That leading members of other hospital
units had been executed as spies by the American
Government.</p>

<p>That canned goods put up by the housewives
were to be seized by the government and appropriated
to the use of the army and navy.</p>

<p>That soldiers in training were being instructed
to put out the eyes of every German
captured.</p>

<p>That all of the “plums” at the officers’ training
camps fell to Roman Catholics. The
plums went to Protestants when the propagandist
talked to a Catholic.</p>

<p>That the registration of women was held so
that girls would be enticed into the cities where
white slaves were made of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>That the battleship Pennsylvania had been
destroyed with everyone on board by a German
submarine.</p>

<p>That more than seventy-five per cent of the
American soldiers in France had been infected
with venereal diseases.</p>

<p>That intoxicants were given freely to American
soldiers in Y. M. C. A. and Knights of
Columbus huts in France.</p>

<p>But the lies and the plots failed to make any
impression on the morale of American citizenry.
In fact, America from the moment
war was declared against Germany until the
time an armistice was declared, seemed to care
for nothing but results. Charges of graft
made with bitter invective in Congress created
scarcely more than a ripple. The harder the
pro-German plotters worked for the destruction
of property and the incitement to labor
disturbances, the closer became the protective
network of Americanism against these anti-war
influences. After half a dozen German
lies had been casually passed from mouth to
mouth as rumors, the American people came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to look upon other mischievous propaganda in
its true light. Patriotic newspapers in every
community exposed the false reports and citizens
everywhere were on their guard against
the misstatements. It was noticeable that the
propaganda was intensified just previous to
and during the several Liberty Loan campaigns.
Proof that the American spirit rises
superior to anti-American influences is furnished
by the glorious records of these Liberty
Loans. Every one was over-subscribed despite
the severest handicaps confronted by any
nation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<span class="smcap">Sinking of the Lusitania</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE United States was brought face to
face with the Great War and with what
it meant in ruthless destruction of life when,
on May 7, 1915, the crack Cunard Liner Lusitania,
bound from New York to Liverpool,
with 1,959 persons aboard, was torpedoed and
sunk by a German submarine off Old Head of
Kinsale, Southwestern Ireland. Two torpedoes
reached their mark. The total number
of lives lost when the ship sunk was 1,198. Of
these 755 were passengers and the remainder
were members of the crew. Of the drowned
passengers, 124 were Americans and 35 were
infants.</p>

<p>“Remember the Lusitania!” later became a
battlecry just as “Remember the Maine!”
acted as a spur to Americans during the war
with Spain. It was first used by the famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
“Black Watch” and later American troops
shouted it as they went into battle.</p>

<p>The sinking of the Lusitania, with its attendant
destruction of life, sent a thrill of horror
through the neutral peoples of the world.
General opposition to the use of submarines in
attacking peaceful shipping, especially passenger
vessels, crystallized as the result of the
tragedy, and a critical diplomatic controversy
between the United States and Germany developed.
The American Government signified
its determination to break off friendly relations
with the German Empire unless the
ruthless practices of the submarine commanders
were terminated. Germany temporarily
agreed to discontinue these practices.</p>

<p>Among the victims of the Cunarder’s destruction
were some of the best known personages
of the Western Hemisphere. Alfred
Gwynne Vanderbilt, multimillionaire; Charles
Frohman, noted theatrical manager; Charles
Klein, dramatist, who wrote “The Lion and
the Mouse”; Justus Miles Forman, author,
and Elbert Hubbard, known as Fra Elbertus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
widely read iconoclastic writer, were drowned.</p>

<p>The ocean off the pleasant southern coast of
Ireland was dotted with bodies for days after
the sinking of the liner. The remains of many
of the victims, however, never were recovered.</p>

<p>When the Lusitania prepared to sail from
New York on her last trip, fifty anonymous
telegrams addressed to prominent persons
aboard the vessel warned the recipients not to
sail with the liner. In addition to these warnings
was an advertisement inserted in the leading
metropolitan newspapers by the German
embassy, advising neutral persons that British
steamships were in danger of destruction in
the war zone about the British Isles. This notice
appeared the day the Lusitania sailed,
May 1st, and was placed next the advertisement
of the Cunard Line:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">NOTICE!</p>

<p>Travelers intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage
are reminded that a state of war exists between
Germany and her allies and Great Britain and her allies;
that the zone of war includes the waters adjacent
to the British Isles; that, in accordance with formal notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
given by the Imperial German Government, vessels
flying the flag of Great Britain or of any of her allies,
are liable to destruction in those waters and that travelers
sailing in the war zone on ships of Great Britain
or her allies do so at their own risk.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; Imperial German Embassy,<br>
Washington, D. C., April 22, 1915.</p>
</div>

<p>Little or no attention was paid to the warnings,
only the usual number of persons canceling
their reservations. The general agent of
the Cunard Line at New York assured the passengers
that the Lusitania’s voyage would be
attended by no risk whatever, referring to the
liner’s speed and watertight compartments.</p>

<p>As the great Cunarder drew near the scene
of her disaster, traveling at moderate speed
along her accustomed route, there was news of
freight steamers falling victims to Germany’s
undersea campaign. It was not definitely established,
however, whether the liner was
warned of danger.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">GERMAN PIRACY ON THE HIGH SEAS</p>

<p>After torpedoing their ship the submarine shelled the lifeboats and jeered at the struggles of the helpless crew.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At two o’clock on the fine afternoon of May
7th, some ten miles off the Old Head of Kinsale,
the Lusitania was sighted by a submarine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
1,000 yards away. A second later the track of
a torpedo, soon followed by another, was seen
and each missile crashed into the Lusitania’s
hull with rending detonations.</p>

<p>Many were killed or injured immediately by
the explosions. Before the liner’s headway
was lost, some boats were lowered, and capsized
as a result. The immediate listing of the
steamship added to the difficulties of rescue
and increased the tragical toll of dead.</p>

<p>Much heroism and calmness were displayed
by many in the few minutes the liner remained
afloat. The bearing of Frohman, Vanderbilt,
Hubbard and other Americans was declared
to have been particularly inspiring.</p>

<p>Rescue ships and naval vessels rushed to the
aid of the survivors from all nearby ports of
Ireland.</p>

<p>It has been said that the sinking of the Lusitania
was carefully planned by the chiefs of the
German admiralty. They expected, it was
believed, to demoralize British shipping and
strike terror into the minds of the British people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
by showing that the largest and swiftest
of liners could easily be destroyed by submarines.</p>

<p>According to the Paris paper, <i>La Guerre
Sociale</i>, published by Gustave Hervé, the submarine
responsible was the U-21, commanded
by Lieutenant Hersing. Hersing was said to
have been decorated for his deed. The U-21
afterwards was destroyed and the story of its
participation in the sinking of the great Cunarder
never was confirmed.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the news of the Lusitania
disaster, President Wilson took steps to hold
Germany to that “strict accountability” of
which he had notified Berlin when the war-zone
operations were begun earlier in the year. His
first communication, protesting against the
sinking of the liner in the name of humanity
and demanding disavowal, indemnity and assurance
that the crime would not be repeated,
was despatched on May 13th. On May 30th
the German reply argued that the liner carried
munitions of war and probably was armed.</p>

<p>The following official German version of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
incident by the German Admiralty Staff over
the signature of Admiral Behncke was given:</p>

<p>“The submarine sighted the steamer, which
showed no flag, May 7th, at 2.20 o’clock, Central
European time, afternoon, on the southeast
coast of Ireland, in fine, clear weather.</p>

<p>“At 3.10 o’clock one torpedo was fired at
the Lusitania, which hit her starboard side below
the captain’s bridge. The detonation of
the torpedo was followed immediately by a
further explosion of extremely strong effect.
The ship quickly listed to starboard and began
to sink.</p>

<p>“The second explosion must be traced back
to the ignition of quantities of ammunition inside
the ship.”</p>

<p>These extenuations were all rejected by the
United States, and the next note prepared by
President Wilson was of such character that
Secretary of State Bryan resigned. This second
communication was sent on June 11th, and
on June 22d another was cabled. September
1st Germany accepted the contentions of the
United States in regard to submarine warfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
upon peaceful shipping. There were continued
negotiations concerning the specific settlement
to be made in the case of the Lusitania.</p>

<p>On February 4th, 1916, arrived a German
proposition which, coupled with personal parleys
carried on between German Ambassador
von Bernstorff and United States Secretary
of State Lansing, seemed in a fair way to conclude
the whole controversy. It was announced
on February 8th that the two nations
were in substantial accord and Germany was
declared to have admitted the sinking of the
liner was wrong and unjustified and promised
that reparation would be made.</p>

<p>However, a week later, when Germany took
advantage of tentative American proposals
concerning the disarming of merchant ships,
by announcing that all armed hostile merchantmen
would be treated as warships and attacked
without warning, the almost completed agreement
was overthrown. The renewed negotiations
were continuing when the torpedoing of
the cross-channel passenger ship Sussex, without
warning, on March 24th, impelled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
United States to issue a virtual ultimatum, demanding
that the Germans immediately cease
their present methods of naval warfare on pain
of the rupture of diplomatic relations with the
most powerful existing neutral nation.</p>

<p>The Lusitania, previous to her sinking, had
figured in the war news, first at the conflict,
when it was feared she had been captured by
a German cruiser while she was dashing across
the Atlantic toward Liverpool, and again in
February of 1915, when she flew the American
flag as a ruse to deceive submarines while crossing
the Irish Sea. This latter incident called
forth a protest from the United States.</p>

<p>On her fatal trip the cargo of the Lusitania
was worth $735,000.</p>

<p>As a great transatlantic liner, the Lusitania
was a product of the race for speed, which was
carried on for years among larger steamship
companies, particularly of England and Germany.
When the Lusitania was launched, it
was the wonder of the maritime world. Its
mastery of the sea, from the standpoint of
speed, was undisputed.</p>

to New York, September 7, 1907, was watched
by the world. The vessel made the voyage in
five days and fifty-four minutes, at that time
a record. Its fastest trip, made on the western
voyage, was four days eleven hours forty-two
minutes. This record, however, was
wrested from it subsequently by the Mauretania,
a sister ship, which set the mark of four
days ten hours forty-one minutes, that still
stands.</p>

<p>Although the Lusitania was surpassed in size
by several other liners built subsequently, it
never lost the reputation acquired at the outset
of its career. Its speed and luxurious accommodations
made it a favorite, and its passenger
lists bore the names of many of the most prominent
Atlantic wayfarers. The vessel was pronounced
by its builders to be as nearly unsinkable
as any ship could be.</p>

<p>Everything about the Lusitania was of colossal
dimensions. Her rudder weighed sixty-five
tons. She carried three anchors of ten
tons each. The main frames and beams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
placed end to end, would extend thirty miles.
The Lusitania was 785 feet long, 88 feet beam,
and 60 feet deep. Her gross tonnage was
32,500 and her net tonnage, 9,145.</p>

<p>Charges were made that one or more guardian
submarines deliberately drove off ships
nearby which might have saved hundreds of
lives lost when the Lusitania went down.
Captain W. F. Wood, of the Leyland Line
Steamer Etonian, said his ship was prevented
from going to the rescue of the passengers of
the sinking Lusitania by a warning that an attack
might be made upon his own vessel.</p>

<p>The Etonian left Liverpool, May 6th.
When Captain Wood was forty-two miles from
Kinsale he received a wireless call from the
Lusitania for immediate assistance.</p>

<p>The call was also picked up by the steamers
City of Exeter and Narragansett. The Narragansett,
Captain Wood said, was made a target
for submarine attack, a torpedo missing
her by a few feet, and her commander then
warned Captain Wood not to attempt to reach
the Lusitania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“It was two o’clock in the afternoon, May
7th, that we received the wireless S O S,” said
Captain Wood. “I was then forty-two miles
distant from the position he gave me. The
Narragansett and the City of Exeter were
nearer the Lusitania and she answered the
S O S.</p>

<p>“At five o’clock I observed the City of Exeter
cross our bows and she signaled, ‘Have you
heard anything of the disaster?’</p>

<p>“At that moment I saw a periscope of a submarine
between the Tonina and the City of
Exeter, about a quarter of a mile directly ahead
of us. She dived as soon as she saw us.</p>

<p>“I signaled to the engine room for every
available inch of speed. Then we saw the submarine
come up astern of us. I now ordered
full speed ahead and we left the submarine behind.
The periscope remained in sight about
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>“No sooner had we lost sight of the submarine
astern, than another appeared on the starboard
bow. This one was directly ahead and
on the surface, not submerged.</p>

<p>The dastardly destruction of this great passenger ship off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland, on May 7, 1915, and the murder of over
1,200 non-combatants, was German’s greatest exploit in crime.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“I starboarded hard away from him, he
swinging as we did. About eight minutes
later he submerged. I continued at top speed
for four hours and saw no more of the submarines.
It was the ship’s speed that saved her,
that’s all.</p>

<p>“The Narragansett, as soon as she heard the
S O S call, went to the assistance of the Lusitania.
One of the submarines discharged a
torpedo at her and missed her by not more
than eight feet. The Narragansett then
warned us not to attempt to go to the rescue,
and I got her wireless call while I was dodging
the two submarines. You can see that three
ships would have gone to the assistance of the
Lusitania had they not been attacked by the
two submarines.”</p>

<p>The German Government defended the
brutal destruction of non-combatants by the
false assertions that the Lusitania was an
armed vessel and that it was carrying a great
store of munitions. Both of these accusations
were proved to be mere fabrications. The
Lusitania was absolutely unarmed and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
nearest approach to munitions was a consignment
of 1,250 empty shell cases and 4,200 cases
of cartridges for small arms.</p>

<p>Intense indignation swept over the neutral
world, the tide rising highest in America. It
well may be said that the destruction of the
Lusitania was one of the greatest factors in
driving the United States into the war against
Germany.</p>

<p>Concerning the charge that the Lusitania
carried munitions, Dudley Field Malone, Collector
of the Port of New York, testified that
he made personal and close inspection of the
ship’s cargo and saw that it carried no guns
and that no munitions were included in its
cargo.</p>

<p>His statement follows:</p>

<p>“This report is not correct. The Lusitania
was inspected before sailing, as is customary.
No guns were found, mounted or unmounted,
and the vessel sailed without any armament.
No merchant ship would be allowed to arm in
this port and leave the harbor.”</p>

<p>Captain W. T. Turner, of the Lusitania,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
testifying before the coroner’s inquest at Kinsale,
Ireland, was interrogated as follows:</p>

<p>“You were aware threats had been made
that the ship would be torpedoed?”</p>

<p>“We were,” the Captain replied.</p>

<p>“Was she armed?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“What precautions did you take?”</p>

<p>“We had all the boats swung when we came
within the danger zone, between the passing of
Fastnet and the time of the accident.”</p>

<p>The coroner asked him whether he had received
a message concerning the sinking of a
ship off Kinsale by a submarine. Captain
Turner replied that he had not received any
such message.</p>

<p>“Did you receive any special instructions as
to the voyage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are you at liberty to tell us what they
were?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you carry them out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to the best of my ability.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Tell us in your own words what happened
after passing Fastnet.”</p>

<p>“The weather was clear,” Captain Turner
answered. “We were going at a speed of
eighteen knots. I was on the port side and
heard Second Officer Hefford call out:</p>

<p>“‘Here’s a torpedo!’</p>

<p>“I ran to the other side and saw clearly the
wake of a torpedo. Smoke and steam came up
between the last two funnels. There was a
slight shock. Immediately after the first explosion
there was another report, but that may
possibly have been internal.</p>

<p>“I at once gave the order to lower the boats
down to the rails, and I directed that women
and children should get into them. I also had
all the bulkheads closed.</p>

<p>“Between the time of passing Fastnet, about
11 o’clock, and of the torpedoing I saw no sign
whatever of any submarines. There was some
haze along the Irish coast, and when we were
near Fastnet I slowed down to fifteen knots.
I was in wireless communication with shore all
the way across.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Captain Turner was asked whether he had
received any message in regard to the presence
of submarines off the Irish coast. He replied
in the affirmative. Questioned regarding the
nature of the message, he replied:</p>

<p>“I respectfully refer you to the Admiralty
for an answer.”</p>

<p>“I also gave orders to stop the ship,” Captain
Turner continued, “but we could not stop.
We found that the engines were out of commission.
It was not safe to lower boats until
the speed was off the vessel. As a matter of
fact, there was a perceptible headway on her
up to the time she went down.</p>

<p>“When she was struck she listed to starboard.
I stood on the bridge when she sank,
and the Lusitania went down under me. She
floated about eighteen minutes after the torpedo
struck her. My watch stopped at 2.36.
I was picked up from among the wreckage and
afterward was brought aboard a trawler.</p>

<p>“No warship was convoying us. I saw no
warship, and none was reported to me as having
been seen. At the time I was picked up I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
noticed bodies floating on the surface, but saw
no living persons.”</p>

<p>“Eighteen knots was not the normal speed
of the Lusitania, was it?”</p>

<p>“At ordinary times,” answered Captain
Turner, “she could make twenty-five knots,
but in war times her speed was reduced to
twenty-one knots. My reason for going eighteen
knots was that I wanted to arrive at Liverpool
bar without stopping, and within two or
three hours of high water.”</p>

<p>“Was there a lookout kept for submarines,
having regard to previous warnings?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we had double lookouts.”</p>

<p>“Were you going a zigzag course at the moment
the torpedoing took place?”</p>

<p>“No. It was bright weather, and land was
clearly visible.”</p>

<p>“Was it possible for a submarine to approach
without being seen?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; quite possible.”</p>

<p>“Something has been said regarding the impossibility
of launching the boats on the port
side?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Yes,” said Captain Turner, “owing to the
listing of the ship.”</p>

<p>“How many boats were launched safely?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say.”</p>

<p>“Were any launched safely?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and one or two on the port side.”</p>

<p>“Were your orders promptly carried out?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Was there any panic on board?”</p>

<p>“No, there was no panic at all. It was almost
calm.”</p>

<p>“How many persons were on board?”</p>

<p>“There were 1,500 passengers and about 600
crew.”</p>

<p>By the foreman of the jury—“In the face
of the warnings at New York that the Lusitania
would be torpedoed, did you make any
application to the Admiralty asking for an
escort?”</p>

<p>“No, I left that to them. It is their business,
not mine. I simply had to carry out my
orders to go, and I would do it again.”</p>

<p>Captain Turner uttered the last words of
this reply with great emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>By the coroner—“I am glad to hear you
say so, Captain.”</p>

<p>By the juryman—“Did you get a wireless
to steer your vessel in a northern direction?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Captain Turner.</p>

<p>“Was the course of the vessel altered after
the torpedoes struck her?”</p>

<p>“I headed straight for land, but it was useless.
Previous to this the watertight bulkheads
were closed. I suppose the explosion
forced them open. I don’t know the exact extent
to which the Lusitania was damaged.”</p>

<p>“There must have been serious damage done
to the watertight bulkheads?”</p>

<p>“There certainly was, without doubt.”</p>

<p>“Were the passengers supplied with lifebelts?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Were any special orders given that morning
that lifebelts be put on?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Was any warning given before you were
torpedoed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“None whatever. It was suddenly done and
finished.”</p>

<p>“If there had been a patrol boat about,
might it have been of assistance?”</p>

<p>“It might, but it is one of those things one
never knows.”</p>

<p>With regard to the threats against his ship,
Captain Turner said he saw nothing except
what appeared in the New York papers the
day before the Lusitania sailed. He had
never heard the passengers talking about the
threats, he said.</p>

<p>“Was a warning given to the lower decks
after the ship had been struck?” Captain Turner
was asked.</p>

<p>“All the passengers must have heard the explosion,”
Captain Turner replied.</p>

<p>Captain Turner, in answer to another question,
said he received no report from the lookout
before the torpedo struck the Lusitania.</p>

<p>Ship’s Bugler Livermore testified that the
watertight compartments were closed, but that
the explosion and the force of the water must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
have burst them open. He said that all the
officers were at their posts and that earlier arrivals
of the rescue craft would not have saved
the situation.</p>

<p>After physicians had testified that the victims
had met death through prolonged immersion
and exhaustion the coroner summed up
the case.</p>

<p>He said that the first torpedo fired by the
German submarine did serious damage to the
Lusitania, but that, not satisfied with this, the
Germans had discharged another torpedo.
The second torpedo, he said, must have been
more deadly, because it went right through the
ship, hastening the work of destruction.</p>

<p>The characteristic courage of the Irish and
British people was manifested at the time of
this terrible disaster, the coroner continued,
and there was no panic. He charged that the
responsibility “lay on the German Government
and the whole people of Germany, who collaborated
in the terrible crime.”</p>

<p>“I propose to ask the jury,” he continued,
“to return the only verdict possible for a self-respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> 
jury, that the men in charge of the
German submarine were guilty of wilful murder.”</p>

<p>The jury then retired and after due deliberation
prepared this verdict:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We find that the deceased met death from prolonged
immersion and exhaustion in the sea eight miles south-southeast
of Old Head of Kinsale, Friday, May 7, 1915,
owing to the sinking of the Lusitania by torpedoes fired
by a German submarine.</p>

<p>We find that the appalling crime was committed contrary
to international law and the conventions of all
civilized nations.</p>

<p>We also charge the officers of said submarine and the
Emperor and the Government of Germany, under whose
orders they acted, with the crime of wholesale murder
before the tribunal of the civilized world.</p>

<p>We desire to express sincere condolences and sympathy
with the relatives of the deceased, the Cunard Company,
and the United States, many of whose citizens
perished in this murderous attack on an unarmed liner.</p>
</div>

<p>President Wilson’s note to Germany, written
consequent on the torpedoing of the Lusitania,
was dated six days later, showing that
time for careful deliberation was duly taken.
The President’s Secretary, Joseph P. Tumulty,
on May 8th made this statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>Of course the President feels the distress and the gravity
of the situation to the utmost, and is considering very
earnestly but very calmly, the right course of action to
pursue. He knows that the people of the country wish
and expect him to act with deliberation as well as with
firmness.</p>
</div>

<p>Although signed by Mr. Bryan, as Secretary
of State, the note was written by the
President in shorthand—a favorite method of
Mr. Wilson in making memoranda—and transcribed
by him on his own typewriter. The
document was presented to the members of the
President’s Cabinet, a draft of it was sent to
Counselor Lansing of the State Department,
and after a few minor changes, it was transmitted
by cable to Ambassador Gerard.</p>

Berlin</i>:</p>

<p>Please call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and

a copy.</p>

<p>In view of the recent acts of the German authorities
in violation of American rights on the high seas, which
culminated in the torpedoing and sinking of the British
steamship Lusitania on May 7, 1915, by which over 100<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
American citizens lost their lives, it is clearly wise and
desirable that the Government of the United States and
the Imperial German Government should come to a clear
and full understanding as to the grave situation which
has resulted.</p>

<p>The sinking of the British passenger steamer Falaba
by a German submarine on March 28th, through which
Leon C. Thrasher, an American citizen, was drowned;
the attack on April 28th, on the American vessel Cushing
by a German aeroplane; the torpedoing on May 1st
of the American vessel Gulflight by a German submarine,
as a result of which two or more American citizens met
their death; and, finally, the torpedoing and sinking of
the steamship Lusitania, constitute a series of events
which the Government of the United States has observed
with growing concern, distress, and amazement.</p>

<p>Recalling the humane and enlightened attitude
hitherto assumed by the Imperial German Government
in matters of international right, and particularly with
regard to the freedom of the seas; having learned to
recognize the German views and the German influence in
the field of international obligation as always engaged
upon the side of justice and humanity; and having understood
the instructions of the Imperial German Government
to its naval commanders to be upon the same plane
of human action prescribed by the naval codes of the
other nations, the Government of the United States was
loath to believe—it cannot now bring itself to believe—that
these acts, so absolutely contrary to the rules, the
practices, and the spirit of modern warfare, could have
the countenance, or sanction of that great government.
It feels it to be its duty, therefore, to address the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
German Government concerning them with the
utmost frankness and in the earnest hope that it is not
mistaken in expecting action on the part of the Imperial
German Government, which will correct the unfortunate
impressions which have been created, and vindicate once
more the position of that government with regard to the
sacred freedom of the seas.</p>

<p>The Government of the United States has been apprised
that the Imperial German Government considered
themselves to be obliged by the extraordinary circumstances
of the present war and the measure adopted by
their adversaries in seeking to cut Germany off from
all commerce, to adopt methods of retaliation which go
much beyond the ordinary methods of warfare at sea, in
the proclamation of a war zone from which they have
warned neutral ships to keep away. This government
has already taken occasion to inform the Imperial German
Government that it cannot admit the adoption of
such measures or such a warning of danger to operate
as in any degree an abbreviation of the rights of American
shipmasters or of American citizens bound on lawful
errands as passengers on merchant ships of belligerent
nationality, and that it must hold the Imperial
German Government to a strict accountability for any
infringement of those rights, intentional or incidental.
It does not understand the Imperial German Government
to question these rights. It assumes, on the contrary,
that the Imperial Government accept, as of
course, the rule that the lives of non-combatants, whether
they be of neutral citizenship or citizens of one of the
nations at war, cannot lawfully or rightfully be put in
jeopardy by the capture or destruction of an unarmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
merchantman, and recognize also, as all other nations
do, the obligation to take the usual precaution of visit
and search to ascertain whether a suspected merchantman
is in fact of belligerent nationality or is in fact
carrying contraband of war under a neutral flag.</p>

<p>The Government of the United States, therefore, desires
to call the attention of the Imperial German Government
with the utmost earnestness to the fact that the
objection to their present method of attack against the
trade of their enemies lies in the practical impossibility
of employing submarines in the destruction of commerce
without disregarding those rules of fairness, reason,
justice, and humanity which all modern opinion regards
as imperative. It is practically impossible for
the officers of a submarine to visit a merchantman at sea
and examine her papers and cargo. It is practically
impossible for them to make a prize of her; and, if they
cannot put a prize crew on board of her, they cannot
sink her without leaving her crew and all on board of
her to the mercy of the sea in her small boats. These
facts, it is understood, the Imperial German Government
frankly admit. We are informed that in the instances
of which we have spoken time enough for even
that poor measure of safety was not given, and in at
least two of the cases cited not so much as a warning
was received. Manifestly, submarines cannot be used
against merchantmen, as the last few weeks have shown,
without an inevitable violation of many sacred principles
of justice and humanity.</p>

<p>American citizens act within their indisputable rights
in taking their ships and in traveling wherever their
legitimate business calls them upon the high seas, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
exercise those rights in what should be the well-justified
confidence that their lives will not be endangered
by acts done in clear violation of universally acknowledged
international obligations, and certainly in the
confidence that their own government will sustain them
in the exercise of their rights.</p>

<p>There was recently published in the newspapers of
the United States, I regret to inform the Imperial German
Government, a formal warning, purporting to come
from the Imperial German Embassy at Washington,
addressed to the people of the United States, and stating,
in effect, that any citizen of the United States who
exercised his right of free travel upon the seas would do
so at his peril if his journey should take him within the
zone of waters within which the Imperial German Navy
was using submarines against the commerce of Great
Britain and France, notwithstanding the respectful but
very earnest protest of the Government of the United
States. I do not refer to this for the purpose of calling
the attention of the Imperial German Government at
this time to the surprising irregularity of a communication
from the Imperial German Embassy at Washington
addressed to the people of the United States through
the newspapers, but only for the purpose of pointing
out that no warning that an unlawful and inhumane act
will be committed can possibly be accepted as an excuse
or palliation for that act or as an abatement of the responsibility
for its commission.</p>

<p>Long acquainted as this government has been with the
character of the Imperial Government, and with the
high principles of equity by which they have in the past
been actuated and guided, the Government of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
States cannot believe that the commanders of the vessels
which committed these acts of lawlessness did so except
under a misapprehension of the orders issued by the Imperial
German naval authorities. It takes for granted
that, at least within the practical possibilities of every
such case, the commanders even of submarines were expected
to do nothing that would involve the lives of
non-combatants or the safety of neutral ships, even at
the cost of failing of their object of capture or destruction.</p>

<p>It confidently expects, therefore, that the Imperial
German Government will disavow the acts of which the
Government of the United States complains; that they
will make reparation so far as reparation is possible for
injuries which are without measure, and that they will
take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence of anything
so obviously subversive of the principles of warfare
for which the Imperial German Government have
in the past so wisely and so firmly contended.</p>

<p>The government and people of the United States look
to the Imperial German Government for just, prompt,
and enlightened action in this vital matter with the
greater confidence, because the United States and Germany
are bound together not only by ties of friendship,
but also by the explicit stipulations of the Treaty of
1828, between the United States and the Kingdom of
Prussia.</p>

<p>Expressions of regret and offers of reparation in case
of the destruction of neutral ships sunk by mistake,
while they may satisfy international obligations, if no
loss of life results, cannot justify or excuse a practice
the natural and necessary effect of which is to subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
neutral nations and neutral persons to new and immeasurable
risks.</p>

<p>The Imperial German Government will not expect the
Government of the United States to omit any word or
any act necessary to the performance of its sacred duty
of maintaining the rights of the United States and its
citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bryan.</span></p>

<p>Ex-President Roosevelt, after learning details
of the sinking of the Lusitania, made these
statements:</p>

<p>“This represents not merely piracy, but
piracy on a vaster scale of murder than old-time
pirate ever practiced. This is the warfare
which destroyed Louvain and Dinant and
hundreds of men, women, and children in Belgium.
It is a warfare against innocent men,
women, and children traveling on the ocean,
and our own fellowcountrymen and countrywomen,
who were among the sufferers.</p>

<p>“It seems inconceivable that we can refrain
from taking action in this matter, for we owe it
not only to humanity, but to our own national
self-respect.”</p>

<p>Former President Taft made this statement:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“I do not wish to embarrass the President
of the Administration by a discussion of the
subject at this stage of the information, except
to express confidence that the President will
follow a wise and patriotic course. We must
bear in mind that if we have a war it is the people,
the men and women, fathers and mothers,
brothers and sisters, who must pay with lives
and money the cost of it, and therefore they
should not be hurried into the sacrifices until
it is made clear that they wish it and know
what they are doing when they wish it.</p>

<p>“I agree that the inhumanity of the circumstances
in the case now presses us on, but in the
heat of even just indignation is this the best
time to act, when action involves such momentous
consequences and means untold loss
of life and treasure? There are things worse
than war, but delay, due to calm deliberation,
cannot change the situation or minimize the effect
of what we finally conclude to do.</p>

<p>“With the present condition of the war in
Europe, our action, if it is to be extreme, will
not lose efficiency by giving time to the people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
whose war it will be, to know what they are
facing.</p>

<p>“A demand for war that cannot survive the
passion of the first days of public indignation
and will not endure the test of delay and deliberation
by all the people is not one that should
be yielded to.”</p>

<p>President Wilson was criticized later by
many persons for not insisting upon a declaration
of war immediately after the sinking of
the Lusitania. Undoubtedly the advice of
former President Taft and of others high in
statesmanship, prevailed with the President.
This in substance was that America should prepare
resolutely and thoroughly, giving Germany
in the meantime no excuse for charges
that America’s entrance into the conflict was
for aggression or for selfish purposes.</p>

<p>It was seen even as early as the sinking of
the Lusitania that Germany’s only hope for
final success lay in the submarine. It was reasoned
that unrestricted submarine warfare
against the shipping of the world, so far as
tended toward the provisioning and munitioning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
of the Allies, would be the inevitable outcome.
It was further seen that when that
declaration would be made by Germany,
America’s decision for war must be made.
The President and his Cabinet thereupon made
all their plans looking toward that eventuality.</p>

<p>The resignation of Mr. Bryan from the
Cabinet was followed by the appointment of
Robert Lansing as Secretary of State. It was
recognized on both sides of the Atlantic that
President Wilson in all essential matters affecting
the war was active in the preparation
of all state papers and in the direction of that
department. Another Cabinet vacancy was
created when Lindley M. Garrison, of New
Jersey, resigned the portfolio of Secretary of
War because of a clash upon his militant views
for preparedness. Newton D. Baker, of
Cleveland, Ohio, a close friend and supporter
of President Wilson, was appointed in his
stead.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<span class="smcap">Steadfast South Africa</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Germany struck at the heart of
France through Belgium simultaneous
action was undertaken by the German Command
in Southwest Africa through propaganda
and mobilization of the available German
troops. Insidiously and by the use of
money systematic propaganda was instituted
to corrupt the Boers against their allegiance
to the Union of South Africa. One great
character stood like a rock against all their efforts.
It was the character of General Louis
Botha, formerly arrayed in battle against the
British during the Boer uprising.</p>

<p>With characteristic determination he formulated
plans for the invasion of German Southwest
Africa without asking permission of the
citizens of the South African Union or of the
British Foreign Office. His vision comprehended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
an invasion that would have as its culmination
a British-Boer colony where the German
colony had been, and that from Cable Bay
to the source of the Nile there would be one
mighty union, with a great trunk railway feeding
Egypt, the Soudan, Rhodesia, Uganda,
and the Union of South Africa. An able
lieutenant to Botha was General Smuts. He
co-operated with his chief in a campaign of
education. They pointed out the absolute
necessity for deafness to the German tempters,
and succeeded in obtaining full co-operation
for the Botha plan of invasion from the British
Imperial Government and the South African
Union. Concerning this agreement General
Botha said:</p>

<p>“To forget their loyalty to the empire in this
hour of trial would be scandalous and shameful,
and would blacken South Africa in the
eyes of the whole world. Of this South Africans
were incapable. They had endured some
of the greatest sacrifices that could be demanded
of a people, but they had always kept
before them ideals, founded on Christianity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
and never in their darkest days had they sought
to gain their ends by treasonable means. The
path of treason was an unknown path to Dutch
and English alike.</p>

<p>“Their duty and their conscience alike bade
them be faithful and true to the Imperial Government
in all respects in this hour of darkness
and trouble. That was the attitude of the
Union Government; that was the attitude of
the people of South Africa. The government
had cabled to the Imperial Government at the
outbreak of war, offering to undertake the defense
of South Africa, thereby releasing the
Imperial troops for service elsewhere. This
was accepted, and the Union Defense Force
was mobilized.”</p>

<p>Preliminary to the invasion of German
Southwest Africa, General Botha proclaimed
martial law throughout the Union. The first
act in consequence of this proclamation was the
arrest of a number of conspirators who were
planning sedition throughout the Union. The
head of this conspiracy was Lieutenant-Colonel
S. G. Maritz. General Beyers and General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
De Wet, both Boer officers of high standing,
co-operated with Maritz in an abortive rebellion.
The situation was most trying for the
native Boers and, to their credit be it recorded,
the great majority of them stood out strongly
against the Germans. Vigorous action by
Botha and Smuts smashed the rebellion in the
fall of 1914. A force acting under General
Botha in person attacked the troops under
General Beyers at Rustemburg on October
27th, and on the next day General Beyers
sought refuge in flight. A smaller force acting
under General Kemp was also routed on
November 5th.</p>

<p>General De Wet opened his campaign of
rebellion on November 7th in an action at
Wimburg, where he defeated a smaller force
of Loyalists under General Cronje. The decisive
battle at Marquard occurred on November
12th, Botha commanding the Loyalist
forces in person and De Wet the rebels. The
victory of Botha in this fierce engagement was
complete. De Wet was routed and was captured
on December 1st with a rear-guard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
fifty-two men. General Beyers was drowned
on December 9th while attempting to escape
from the Vall into the Transvaal. This virtually
ended all opposition to General Botha.
The invasion of German Southwest Africa
began on January 5, 1915, and was one uninterrupted
chapter of successes. Through
jungle and swamp, swept by torrential rains
and encountering obstacles that would have
disheartened any but the stoutest heart, the
little force of invasion swept forward. Most
of the engagements by the enemy were in the
nature of guerrilla and rear-guard actions.
The backbone of the German command was
broken and the remaining forces capitulated in
July, 1915.</p>

<p>With the capitulation came the story of the
German mismanagement in Southwest Africa,
and particularly their horrible treatment of the
Hereros and Hottentots in the country misgoverned
by them. An official report fully
authenticated was made and none of its essential
details were refuted.</p>

<p>The report told the story of how the German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
authorities exterminated the native Hereros.
When Germany annexed the country in 1890
they were believed to possess well over 150,000
head of cattle. After the rinderpest scourge
of 1897 they still owned something like 90,000
head. By 1902, less than ten years after the
arrival of the first German settlers, the Hereros
had only 45,898 head of cattle, while the
1,051 German traders and farmers then in the
country owned 44,487. The policy of robbing
and killing the natives had by that time received
the sanction of Berlin. By the end of
1905 the surviving Hereros had been reduced
to pauperism and possessed nothing at all. In
1907 the Imperial German Government by
ordinance prohibited the natives of Southwest
Africa from possessing live stock.</p>

<p>The wholesale theft of the natives’ cattle,
their only wealth, with the direct connivance
and approval of the Berlin Government, was
one of the primary causes of the Herero rebellion
of 1904. The revolt was suppressed
with characteristic German ruthlessness. But
the Germans were not content with a mere suppression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
of the rising; they had decided upon
the practical extinction of the whole tribe.
For this purpose Leutwein, who was apparently
regarded as too lenient, was superseded
by von Trotha, noted for his merciless severity.
He had played a notorious part in the Chinese
Boxer rebellion, and had just suppressed the
Arab rising in German East Africa by the
wholesale massacre of men, women, and children.
As a preliminary von Trotha invited
the Herero chiefs to come in and make peace,
“as the war was now over,” and promptly shot
them in cold blood. Then he issued his notorious
“extermination order,” in terms of
which no Herero—man, woman, child, or babe—was
to receive mercy or quarter. “Kill
every one of them,” he said, “and take no
prisoners.”</p>

<p>The hanging of natives was a common occurrence.
A German officer had the right to
order a native to be hanged. No trial or court
was necessary. Many were hanged merely on
suspicion.</p>

<p>The Hereros were far more humane in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
field than the Germans. They were once a
fine race. Now there is only a miserable remnant
left.</p>

<p>This is amply proved by official German
statistics. Out of between 80,000 and 90,000
souls, only about 15,000 starving and fugitive
Hereros were alive at the end of 1905, when
von Trotha relinquished his task. In 1911,
after all rebellions had been suppressed and
tranquillity restored, the government had a
census taken. The figures, reproduced below,
speak for themselves:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Hereros</td><td class="tdr">         80,000</td><td class="tdr">  15,130</td><td class="tdr">  64,870</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hottentots</td><td class="tdr">      20,000</td><td class="tdr">   9,781</td><td class="tdr">  10,219</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Berg-Damaras</td><td class="tdr">    30,000</td><td class="tdr">  12,831</td><td class="tdr">  17,169</td></tr> 
<tr><td>&#160;</td><td class="tdr">  ———</td><td class="tdr">  ———</td><td class="tdr">  ———</td></tr> 
<tr><td>&#160;</td><td class="tdr">130,000</td><td class="tdr">  37,742</td><td class="tdr"> 92,258</td></tr> 
</table>

<p>In other words, eighty per cent of the Herero
people disappeared, and more than half of the
Hottentot and Berg-Damara races shared the
same fate. Dr. Paul Rohrbach’s dictum, “It
is applicable to a nation in the same way as to
the individual that the right of existence is
primarily justified in the degree that such existence
is useful for progress and general development,”
comes forcibly to mind. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
natives of Southwest Africa had been weighed
in the German balance and had been found
wanting.</p>

<p>Germany lost more than a million square
miles of territory in Africa as a direct consequence
of General Botha’s bold action.
These are divided in four great regions, Southwest
Africa, Kamerun, Togo and East Africa.
Togoland as this region is popularly known
extends from the north shore of the Gulf of
Guinea into the interior and is bounded by
French and British colonies. By a joint attack
of French and British forces, beginning
the second week in August, 1914, the German
power in this rich domain was completely
broken, and the conquest of Togoland was
complete on August 26, 1914. The military
operation was of a desultory nature, and the
losses negligible in view of the area of 33,000
square miles of highly productive land passed
from German control.</p>

<p>The fighting in the great region of Kamerun
was somewhat more stubborn than that in
Togoland. The villages of Bonaberi and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Duala were particularly well defended. The
British and French fought through swamps
and jungle under the handicap of terrific heat,
and always with victory at the end of the engagement.
The conquest of the Kamerun
was complete by the end of June, 1915. In
addition to the operations by the British and
French a combined Belgian and French force
captured Molundu and Ngaundera in the German
Congo.</p>

<p>The raids by General Botha on German
Southwest Africa commenced on September
27, 1914. A series of brilliant strategic actions
resulted in the conquest of a region once
and a half the size of the German Empire at
the time the Great War began. A British description
of the operation states:</p>

<p>The occupation of Windhoek was effected
by General Botha’s North Damaraland forces
working along the railway from Swakopmund.
At the former place General Vanderventer
joined up with General Botha’s forces. The
force from Swakopmund met with considerable
opposition, first at Tretskopje, a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
township in the great Namib Desert fifty miles
to the northeast of Swakopmund, and secondly
at Otjimbingwe, on the Swakop River,
sixty miles northwest of Windhoek. Apart
from these two determined stands, however,
little other opposition was encountered, and
Karibib was occupied on May 5th and Okahandja
and Windhoek on May 12th. With
the fall of the latter place, 3,000 Europeans
and 12,000 natives became prisoners.</p>

<p>The wireless station—one of Germany’s
most valuable high-power stations, which was
able to communicate with one relay only, with
Berlin—was captured almost intact, and much
rolling stock also fell into the hands of the
Union forces.</p>

<p>The advance from the south along the Luderitzbucht-Seeheim-Keetmanshoop
Railway,
approximately 500 miles in length, was made
by two forces which joined hands at Keetmanshoop.
The advance from Aus (captured on
April 10th) was made by General Smuts’s
forces. Colonel (afterward General) Vanderventer,
moving up from the direction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Warmbad and Kalkfontein, around the flanks
of Karas Mountain, pushed on after reaching
Keetmanshoop in the direction of Gibeon.
Bethany had previously been occupied during
the advance to Seeheim. At Kabus, twenty
miles to the north of Keetmanshoop, and at
Gibeon pitched battles were fought between
General Vanderventer’s forces and the enemy.
No other opposition of importance was encountered,
and the operations were brought to
a successful conclusion.</p>

<p>The stiffest fighting in all Africa came in
German East Africa. It began in late September,
1914, and continued until mid-June,
1915. The Germans, curiously enough, commenced
the offensive here with an attack upon
Monbasa, the terminus of the Uganda railway
and the capital of British East Africa. The
attack was planned as a joint naval and military
operation, the German cruiser Koenigsburg
being assigned to move into the harbor
and bombard the town simultaneously with the
assault by land. The plan went awry when
the presence of British warships frightened off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the Koenigsburg. The land attack was easily
checked by a detachment of the King’s African
Rifles and native Arabian troops until the detachments
of Indian Regulars arrived upon
the scene. The enemy thereupon retreated to
his original plans.</p>

<p>British reprisals came early in November,
when the towns of Tanga and Gassin were attacked
by British troops. The troops selected
for this adventure numbered 6,000 and carried
only food, water, guns and munitions. No
protection of any kind nor any other equipment
was taken by the soldiers. Reinforcements
to the German forces delayed the capture
of Gassin until January. A garrison of
three hundred men was left there and this in
turn was besieged by three thousand Germans.
After a stubborn defense the Germans recaptured
the town. A union of two British forces
was accomplished early in June, 1915. One
of these cut through German East Africa
along the Kagera River and the other advanced
on steamers from Kisumu. They met
the enemy on June 22d and defeated it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
heavy casualties. Later General Tighe, commanding
the combined British forces, was congratulated
on the completeness of his victory
on June 28th, by General Kitchener.</p>

<p>The territory acquired by the British as a
consequence of the invasion of Germany’s
African possessions, possesses formidable natural
barriers, but once these are past the
traveller finds lands of wonderful fertility and
great natural resources. Approaching German
Southwest Africa from the east, access is
across the Kalahari Desert. This in its trackless
desolation, its frequent sand-storms and
torrid heat through which only the hardiest and
best provisioned caravans may penetrate is
worse than the worst that Sahara can show.
There is not a sign of life. Approached from
the sea the principal port is Walfish Bay, a
fair harbor that was improved by the British
when they occupied it. Near Walfish some of
the largest diamonds in the history of the world
have been found and gold fields of considerable
richness have been worked. The climate of
German Southwest Africa, after the torrential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
storms of the seacoast and the terrific heat of
the desert have been passed, is one of the most
salubrious in the world. It is unique among
African regions in the opportunities it affords
for colonization by white men. Great Britain
possessed large holdings of this land before
Germany came into possession, but abandoned
them under the belief that the region was comparatively
worthless. There was no misapprehension
on this score when all of the lands
came into the possession of England as the
result of the war.</p>
